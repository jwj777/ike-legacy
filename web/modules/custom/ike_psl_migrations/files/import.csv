Named “Grandma’s Pantry,” under the justification that Grandma was always prepared for unexpected company, the program called for each household to have a ready supply of food and water in case of attack. In response, the Eisenhower administration looked to develop a food that was nutritious, cheap, easy to eat, shelf-stable, and reproducible on a mass scale. All other attributes, including taste, would be disregarded in favor of the ultimate survival food, one that could be stored underground indefinitely. The general public began to stock up on such products, like this tin of Survival Crackers.

Inside the device is a microscopic scale with a hairline indicator. This shows the amount of radiation absorbed by the device since the last time it was reset to zero. The dosimeter is reset by charging it with electricity using with a dosimeter charger (also found in the primary source library). This instrument measured the amount of radiation (roentgen) that objects might have. This CD V-742 was a direct-reading (self-reading) pocket dosimeter that measured exposures from 0 – 200 roentgen (R). The CDV-742 can be identified by its bronze or gold colored pocket clip. The CDV-742 high range dosimeter is the standard for use in shelter, WER [Weapons Effects Reporting] Stations, emergency service organizations and vital facilities. They would also be used by the millions of civil preparedness workers that would be needed for recovery operations during the postattack period when emergence from shelter is possible.

"264","Book, Our Friend the Atom","11.06OurFriendTheAtom.png","In 1956, a little more than a decade after the atomic bomb showed the world the devastating power of nuclear weapons, Walt Disney partnered with German physicist Heinz Haber, a professor at USC and personal science consultant to the legendary animator, to produce Our Friend the Atom — a gloriously illustrated 165-page book extolling the promise of atomic power as a generative rather than destructive force. The illustrations were done by twenty-two Disney artists. It was part of the publicity campaign for peaceful uses of atomic energy, following President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace speech at the United Nations' General Assembly in December 1953.     In 1957, the Disneyland tv series also created an episode based on the same premise and artwork and hosted by Heinz Haber.","3D","","<script async src='https://api.cappasity.com/api/player/cappasity-ai'></script><iframe width='100%' height='600px' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen='true' webkitallowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' src='https://api.cappasity.com/api/player/626f6238-1a5b-4241-bd24-b8e7cc6f1f63/embedded?autorun=0&closebutton=1&logo=1&analytics=1&uipadx=0&uipady=0&enablestoreurl=0&storeurl=&hidehints=0&autorotate=0&autorotatetime=10&autorotatedelay=2&autorotatedir=1&hidefullscreen=1&hideautorotateopt=1&hidesettingsbtn=0&enableimagezoom=1&zoomquality=1&hidezoomopt=0&arbutton=1' ></iframe>","","Original","This copy was published in 1961.","Written by Heinz Haber, Illustrated by Walt Disney, Published by Golden Press","Duck and Cover","Presidency","IKEducation","Duck and Cover; fallout shelter; Civil Defense; Bomb Shelter; atomic bomb; Atomic energy; Atom","","11.06"
