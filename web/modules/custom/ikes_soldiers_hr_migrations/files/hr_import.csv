Participating in several training maneuvers and Camps in the United States as a tank driver with Company D, 34th Tank Battalion, 5th Armored Division. The 5th landed on Utah Beach on 24 July, 1944. They participated in the attack with the 3rd Army in early August in the breakout at Avrancehs, France. By August 8th they were in LaMans, fought in the battle of 'Falaise Gap,' then headed east and on August 20, 22, 23, and the 24th, the 5th Armored Division was all over the Seine River and headed to Paris where they paraded on through by the end of August heading nort east with the 1st Army. By September they were at Sedan where the 5th was the first unit across the Meuse River. Attacking east the 5th crossed the Our River and was also the first American Troops in Germany to reach the Siegfried Line. Heading north they were in St Vith in mid November and when the Battle of the Bulge started they fought at Monschu, Rotgen, Maubach, & Widen. On Lenny's 23rd birthday, February 28th, the 5th was in Hornbroek and heading north for 'The Ruhr' and crossed the Rhine at Wesel. The end of March they were at Munster and rapidly advancing, on the 12th of April they reached the Elbe River, and the 5th became the nearest American Division to Hitler's Berlin. On 23 April, Lenny's Company D, after two days of fighting at Tangermunde, raced 55 miles north to the Klotze Forest and fought the Von Clause Division. A newspaper article quoted Lenny. 'We lined up, and they started coming out of the woods at us and we were knocking them off, let me tell you. But they had a lot of stuff in there---armor, infantry, bazookas, oh, that 88 was something. It could go through a tank like putting your finger through a paper. They had horses, too, and a lot of those poor horses got killed. I guess they finally just said 'This is crazy' and gave up.' Klotze Forest was the last fight for Lenny and the 5th. Lenny told me that he had been blown out of two tanks in his fighting across Europe but no Purple Hearts. Two weeks later the war ended. His 4 battle stars are for Northern France-Ardennes-Rhineland and Central Europe. He was awarded European African Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon with four Bronze Stars, two Overseas Service Bar, one Service Strip Good Conduct, American Theater, WWII Victory Medal. On 26 September, 1945 he boarded a transport for the USA and on 15 December, 1945, he was separated from the Army at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. ","","George J. Green",""

Although wounded, he still managed to save three British civilians. For Jack's heroic actions, the Lord Mayor of Kingston-on-Thames honored Jack at a ceremony outside London on September 11, 2001; this was at the same time that the terrorist attacks in the United States were taking place. Jack spent much of his career as a salesman for Rheingold Breweries.

Dad guessed we were about to enter the war during my junior year and suggested I join the Navy then, rather than being drafted. Enlisting on a Kiddy Cruise (I was just 17), I was sent to the San Diego Naval Training Station where I was assigned to the USS Tangier. We sailed our maiden cruise to Honolulu. The Tangier was to go on maneuvers with the fleet on Dec 7th or 8th so the ship's two seaplanes were sent to Ford Island to await its return, and I and several shipmates were selected to baby sit them. On Dec. 7th I was awakened by a large explosion which shook the bunkroom on the second floor that faced Diamond Head. I jumped up, feeling a second explosion as I ran to the window. I then felt several smaller explosions and saw an aircraft with large red balls on the wings crossing low in the hangar area from south to north, banking around and climbing. We put on our white pants, shoes and hats and ran downstairs. As I came down the stairway, men were breaking out all the glass in the doors and windows. A boatswain's mate shouted for me and several others to keep low and follow him. Aircraft machine gun tracers were going past us and we could hear explosions and breaking glass. Led to the armory, an old Chief grabbed me, threw two belts over my shoulder, a rifle and a gas mask and told me and another seaman to go up on the roof of the Operations Building. I remember running all the way there and up the narrow stairway to the roof which was about 20' x 30' with a 24” or 30” wall around it and a small permanent shed which held cleaning materials. Except for the area in front of us, we had a view of everything up to the fuel dumps and the hospital on the hills. Planes were coming across the water from the Navy Yard, flying low, dropping bombs and torpedoes on the West Virginia, California, and Arizona, flying directly over us strafing, then doing the same to the Tangier, Utah, and Raleigh, making a high turn over Beckoning Point and the Pan Am base and returning. I saw only two aircraft hit and go down. I saw the USS Shaw get hit on its bow in dry-dock while we loaded our rifles and watched the waves of aircraft coming. As they approached, we went behind the shed, fired as they passed directly overhead, ran to the opposite side, and fired again. I remember saying we could have done better with hand grenades as they were so low we could see the pilot and man in the rear. Two Marines came, uncrated a Browning water-cooled machine gun in about 2 minutes and fired it without water until the barrel was so hot the tracers were corkscrewing out. We shot all our ammo at the aircraft right over our heads and the marines fired their gun until it froze. I saw the Nevada get under way and try to move out, the Shaw took a direct hit and exploded, and the Oglala rolled over. Whaleboats, captain's gigs, and the ferry were strafed and people were burning in the water. I saw bombs dropped on the Arizona and felt the explosions. Relieved at about 1100, our ears were ringing and the roof deck was covered with small pieces of paper. The California was just below us, lying sideways, and firing its large guns at an angle towards us. As a result, we had red marks over our right side, arms and faces from the shells’ wadding hitting us. Not really hungry, but at the mess hall because I was told to eat, I saw men in everything I could think of; dirty clothes, shorts to Admiral's coats, some wounded, but no one I knew. Sick and frightened for the first time, I looked back against the wall. Under the tables were several rows of dead men. As I looked at the cold chicken, orange juice and dead men, I left the mess hall without eating. To this day, I still cannot eat cold chicken. Our two aircraft were parked in front of the second hangar from the one that had been hit, and we began working to make one of them flyable. No more than three or four hours had passed. The rest of the day we had several false alarms of air raids. As it grew dark, we became more apprehensive since the rumors were that the Japanese transports would be landing at night. The next day we went back to work on our aircraft. I reported back to our ship regarding the damage. Capt. C.F. Sprague told me to forget the aircraft and tell everyone to get back aboard NOW. Our ship departed Pearl Harbor with a large Naval task force. We were supposed to reinforce the Marines at Wake Island. However, we were delayed by refueling problems with the USS Saratoga and a Destroyer in our group. As a result, Wake Island was taken over by the Japanese. That delay most likely saved the Tangier crew. Later, we went back out in the Pacific to attend to various seaplane duties. I was re-assigned to NAS Anacostia, DC, in April 1943 until March 1947 as a 2nd Class Aviation Metalsmith. I then joined the Navy Reserves, re-assigned to NARTU Anacostia, where I made First Class then changed my rate. To Aviation Electronics Tech. First Class. I retired from the US Navy in 1960 and went to work for the FAA in Washington, DC, and Oklahoma City. I retired from the FAA in 1988 with total government service of 48 years in Naval and civil aviation. ","","Wife, Irma L. Barrigan and Daughter Sherry May",""

Specially cited in John Gibbs report of 7/31/1946 American POW Information Bureau re: Fukuoka Camp #10 (formerly #7): 'Captain Barshop, Army Medical Corp, was Camp Surgeon, but worked under the direction of a Japanese officer who shifted his responsibilities upon the shoulders of the American officer who, by temperament and medical skill, is credited with saving many lives and boosting morale under disheartening conditions. Captain Barshop also protected the prisoners against work decrees issued by the Japanese Camp physician when they were too weak to stand for even a brief period.'
An M.D. at 20, Major Barshop was stationed in the Philippines. After Pearl Harbor, during the battle for Bataan, at Camp O'Donnell, her performed surgery and cared for the sick and wounded with other medical personnel for six days with only infrequent 15 minute rest periods. He was taken prisoner when Bataan fell. At one internment camp, her performed surgery on and cured the chronically-infected foot of the Japanese commandant. Offered personal favors and special rations, he steadfastly refused, holding out for soy protein and medication for his patients. When the commandant finally relented and sent rations, many prisoners' lives were saved. A fellow medical officer, Harry Levitt, recalled 'Barsh' was the only prisoner who refused to barter rare cigarette rations for other prisoner's food because he know that with their severer malnutrition it would be hastening their deaths. He simply gave his away.
When allowed to send one letter home after arriving in Japan on the 'hell ships' from the Phillippines, he wrote his family, 'I can only tell you it is like Forest Lawn over here,' Japanese censors had no idea Forest Lawn was a cemetery, so his letter made it home. As eventually did Major Barshop, who went on to have a wonderful surgical practice for another 50 years. He was one of three doctors who founded Mt. Sinai of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. In 1949, he married Coe Thelma Fisher, a graduate of the U.S. Army Nursing Corps and had three children.

With three sons already serving overseas, his decision greatly upset his parents. Completing basic training at Fort Ord, California, he sent a recorded message home reassuring them, 'It is going to be a long time until you hear my voice... I can't tell you where I am, but... I know where I'm going and the job I have to do. You don't have to worry about me. All I want you to do is save my old place at the table at Christmas.'

Assigned to the 96th Division, he shipped out with other replacement troops from Seattle, Washington. In open water his transport ship encountered large convoys. Amidst an ever-growing armada came the realization that an enormous invasion was being prepared -- possibly the island of Japan itself. He recalled that soldiers were not as much concerned with whether they'd die -- but when. 'Nobody wanted to be the last man killed in war.'

Attached to the 383rd, L Co he engaged the enemy within days of landing on the island of Okinawa. His ultimate baptism under fire came on April 9, 1945, when he and the men he served with fought in the Battle of Kakazu Ridge. In this heroic struggle for survival, he received his combat infantry badge along with an unwavering devotion for his commanding officer, Lt. Willard 'Hoss' Mitchell. He often spoke of Mitchell in the highest terms. 'They should have put him in charge' he'd say, 'He would have ended the war a hell of a lot sooner!'

He was severely wound on the Medeera Escarpments on June 6th, 1945 -- just 15-days prior to the end of the war. After reaching the top of the escarpment, he and a fellow soldier named Casey met machine gun and mortar fire. Casey was instantly killed. Mortally wounded, our father fell off the escarpment's edge. Landing on a ledge, the battle raged around him as he fell in and out of consciousness. Later in the night he received secondary injuries from the shrapnel of an exploding grenade. Near death, he was found the following morning after American forces secured the ridge.

On August 26, 1947, our father returned home from war. For service to his county, Sergeant Harry Thomas Boyle was awarded the Combat Infantry Badge, Bronze Star (BMS), Purple Heart, Asiatic/Pacific Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and Good Conduct Medal. In a retail career lasting 32-years, he worked his way up the corporate ladder from Warehouseman to District Supervisor of Sales for Payless Drug stores.

While he served in relative safety behind the front lines, he was not removed from the realities of war. Family members indicated the war and his participation in it had greatly affected him. As a member of the ground crews, he was aware of planes that did not return from their mission. Aircraft that did returned required his services. This meant working in fuselages which contained the physical evidence of injuries and deaths sustain by the crew. Undoubtedly, he had some form of personal contact with the men that flew these missions. It is inconceivable that he was not affected by such loss.

In a May 27, 1945 letter home to his parents and younger brother Harry, our Uncle Ray wrote '... just finishing our V-Day celebrations.... Talking about coming home lately its just rumors here and there, but as I finally read in our Army paper, that some of the Eight Air Force (thats me) have already landed in the states.

Gerald trained with the 25th Marines, Fourth Division. He shares 'We were loaded on ships and for well over 90 days we Practiced landing and running off the landing crafts, getting ready for battle. Then the practice was put to use when Gerald and others found out they were being sent to a little island called Iwo Jima. Gerald remembers the battle ships shelling the island for several days and nights. He wondered if there was going to be anything left of the island. Then he tells of being loaded from the large ship into a landing craft. Bullets were heard all around him. Some men fell in the water as the craft had not gotten close enough to the land. Along the black beaches there were fence, posts, and large holes, made by the shelling. Bodies of the fallen soldiers were everywhere. Gerald reports that the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Marine Divisions landed in 500 landing crafts in 10 waves onto various beaches that were named after colors. 'The Japanese commander knew a landing of American troops were coming and had hidden 800 cannons in caves and blockhouses. The Marines were met with heavy fire. 'We medics were supposed to work as a team but there were so many wounded lying everywhere that everyone split up and worked as fast as we could.' Gerald was armed with a M1 rifle and a medical bag, but he stated that there were so many wounded, that needed help, the supplies quickly ran out, so they had to use whatever was available to treat the soldiers. 'We patched them up as best we could and then carried them out for further help'. All the time he and the other medics worked under heavy fire. 'You couldn't see where you were going. At first you'd try to duck, but after a while you'd just go on as usual running to where you were needed'. Some soldiers knew they were dying. Gerald remembers one such soldier that he stopped to help saying, 'go ahead and help someone else, the life in me has just about ran out'. 'We tried to carry the wounded out and radio for help but sometimes we just couldn't get any help. It was terrible the soldiers were so brave'.

The next mission was to Hamm, where Owen lost a good friend, George Carter from Chicago who was on another bomber. Owen completed 35 missions with each one of different exposures. He was concerned 'how would he react, would he do his job correctly, would he show fear.' Each mission was hours of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer terror! He does not remember what happened on some of his missions, but still remembers the one on the first part of May 1944. It was to the Herman Goering Steel Plant near Brunswick, Germany. Lots of fighters hit them and they lost 15 to 20 bombers that day. As the fighters started their run, he remembers the Pilot, Rod McKay, saying 'Boys, give your hearts to God because Hitler's got your a**.' He remembers one fighter starting his run at them and firing about 1000 yards away. His 20mm shells burst in the air before they reached them. He opened fire at him when he was about 500 yards away and as the distance closed, he thought he was going to ram them. At about 200 yards, he forgot about firing short bursts and fired point blank, holding the trigger down. He knew he hit him as the tracers were bouncing off the armor plate. His guns stopped firing and he passed about 30 feet over the top of the formation. All this time, Owen's knees were shaking. They lost one engine on the way back to base; they had been hit by three 20mm shells and had over 100 holes in their aircraft. They, along with three others could not keep up with the formation. They and one other plane made it back while another had gone down. After completion of his required missions, he was sent to France at the forward airfields as a ground radio operator. Owen returned to the USA on 2 Nov 1944. After 30 days leave, he reported to replacement pool for crewman for the B-29 Bomber at a West Coast Army Air Force Base. The Sergeant Major interviewing him for reassignment was impressed that in the nine months he had served in the European Theater of Operations, he had completed 35 combat missions and served on the ground in France. He said as far as he was concerned that Owen had already done his service in the war and no way was he going to assign him to a B-29 crew. He graciously sent him to a C-54 Logistic crew that was delivering materials to the Islands in the Asiatic Pacific Theater of Operations. He served there until his discharge on 24 Oct 1945 at Truax Fie","","George J. Green",""

But with old weapons, no water or food, and low and ammunition and morale, the 9th of April, 1942, they surrendered to the Japanese. Juan was among 75,000 American and Filipino prisoners who were forced-marched 70 miles to a prison camp in what we now call the Bataan Death March. They had no water, food or medicine. Malaria was common among the prisoners. Many died due to malaria and malnutrition. Many prisoners were beaten, starved or killed with bayonets. Many died on the roadside. Juan was so sick with malaria he fell out of the marching column. The Japanese shot him in the leg and kicked him down a hill. The saw there was no movement from his frail body, assumed he was dead and left him. Juan regained consciousness and waited until after dark to crawl his way back up to the mountain to his home village. His family was grieving his death when he walked into the village because they heard he was captures and a prisoner. His father took him and made him drink the broth from bitter leaves which had a natural ingredient of quinine for the malaria. After his recovery, Juan fought Japanese soldiers as a guerilla fighter with other Filipino survivors. He then joined the U.S. Army to help them fight against the Japanese.

SR 'Bert' story: I was sworn into the U.S. Army on January 22, 1943. I was taken by bus to Camp Anza, Riverside, California, for testing. I then took a train to Fort Eustis Virginia, for training on a 40 mm gun (antiaircraft gun). I then took a train to Camp Pickett, Virginia. I joined the 400th. AAA AW Battalion, which was attached to the 45th division. We shipped overseas June 8, 1943. We made a practice landing by Oran, North Africa. We got back on the ship and made the Invasion of Sicily. I landed at Scoglitti, Sicily. Battery 'C' was attached to the 3rd, Battalion, 180th. Infantry, 45th Division. In Corsica our Battalion was transferred to the 31st. AAA Brigade. While going over seas my 40 Mm Gun was mounted on the ship's deck, port side so we could practice firing our gun. When we made an Assault landing at Scoglitti, Sicily, there was a sandbar about 100 yards out. We pulled our gun on to the sandbar and left it there, and waded ashore, with the rifles overhead. Later on a duck I pulled my gun from the sandbar to the beach, and we began firing our gun. My second Lt. was killed, landing in front of a machine gun nest on the beach. One of my gun crew members was killed by a strafing German plane on the beach. After the Sicilian campaign, we loaded onto an LST, made an assault landing at Paestum, Italy. We then traveled up Italy, to Mt. Casino. I was combat wounded on October 23, 1943, outside of Mt. Casino, Italy. I was evacuated to the 95th Evacuation Hospital in Naples, Italy. I was awarded the Purple Heart Medal No. 178817. We went to Corsica. Later on we boarded a LST and went into Southern France. Then we traveled up to Mets, France. Later on we turned in our guns, and started guarding German POWs. We then went to Chartres, France, and started guarding German POWs at a Prison War Camp. Later on we went to Brussels, Belgium and worked as military MPs. When the war ended, I had 88 points, so then I went to Le Havre, France, and stayed in Camp Lucky Strike. I boarded the ship William T Barry, sailed home Oct. 3, 1945. I was discharged at Fort MacArthur California October 24, 1945. I have gone back to Europe twice, and placed flowers on my buddies graves that were in the 400th, that are still buried there. Most of my buddies were returned to the states for internment. Placing flowers on their graves was something I always wanted to do, to let them know they have not been forgotten. The Television History Channel came to my house, and interviewed me for the Patton 360 Television Show in 2009. Part of my interview was in The Series Baptism of Blood, The Invasion of Sicily, in July 1943. ","","Wife, Anita A. Fernald and children",""

His last station was at the airbase in Dunkeswell, Devon, England - he received an Air Medal with three gold stars for his hours of flying time over the Bay of Biscay patrolling for U-Boats.

I failed the vision test, so waited for my draft date, for after graduation from high school. At induction at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas I indicated a preference for Navy service and was assigned to the Army Air Corp. I took basic at Buckley Field, Colorado, followed by the 27 week radio mechanic training at Truax Field Wisconsin. I was transferred to advanced radio transmitter school at Shepard Air Force Base in Texas, and then routed to San Francisco to join an invasion unit headed to Japan. Fortunately for me, the bomb was dropped while we were staging in Utah. My part of our unit was transferred to Saipan for several weeks, then to Tinian Island. I was immediately assigned to 'acting' sergeant because that part of our unit had been reduced to skeleton size by rotation after the treaty. Two months later I was flown to a Repo Depot at Manila, Philippines, and assigned to a Distance Finding Station on Palawan Island, Philippines, where I was finally using the skills for which I was trained. Six weeks later I was re-assigned to Control Tower Operator 552 while the pursuit wing was being deactivated for the same reason that I was supply sergeant on Tinian. I received no rank for either of those positions, however, I was rated corporal before leaving Palawan. The political situation in the Philippines during my time on Palawan produced some interesting, but scary incidents, because the young men who made up the pro-independence group were armed and were hostile toward us most of the time. Problems developed for us with them at check points that they had set up on the main road that we had to travel from our station to headquarters and back for our meals and orders. We had to be very careful what we said and how we acted in their presence. Control from Manila was supposed to be through the political organization on Palawan, but it was actually by the local Philippine military commanding civilians. It appeared to me that they seemed to forget why we were there in the first place. After my separation, at the convenience of the government, thanks to the G.I. Bill, I graduated from the University of Kansas in 1952 with a B.S. in Education, married in 1957, moved to Chanute, Kansas, helped rear a son and a daughter, and retired from education in 1989. As is the case with many of us, I'm sure, I wouldn't take a million dollars for my military experience but I wouldn't give a dime to have it again. ","","Robert H. Geiger",""

Deciding to get on with life, he married, became an automobile mechanic, farmer and held other jobs that fit his personality. Born on a farm in the Upland area in NE Dickinson County, he graduated from Enterprise HS in 1942. Enlisting in the Army Air Corp after driving a cement truck during the construction of the Herington AB, he had basic training at St. Petersburg, FL, and was trained in radio communications. On 10 Sep 1944 he left a New Jersey port for Glasgow, Scotland, rode a train to Stone, England, and flew to Chateau Dun, France. Flying his first mission on a B-26 on Sep 27, Marvin, a radio operator, also manned waist guns when in enemy territory. On Dec 23, a cold cloudy morning during the Battle of the Bulge, his crew went airborne at 0900. 'We were flying about 18,000 feet on the lower left of the last echelon of the group when our lead pilot went left instead of right. When he realized, we were far from the rest of the group, couldn't catch up and fighters came in and shot us up. I was the only gun in operation and I found out later I had shot down a ME 109. Then, a shell came through the fuselage just to the left of my head. It exploded and I got shrapnel holes in my face. The shell hit our top turret gunner, an extra on his first mission. I didn't even know his name.' Given the order to bail, Marvin helped the unconscious gunner by snapping his chute and pushing him out. 'I bailed out and just as I did, the left wing exploded and fell off, burning me all over.' The injuries left him with no eyebrows or eyelashes. Landing on a roof, the jolt left him unconscious. 'When I came to, many guns and people were staring at me. They made me carry my parachute and walk to a medical station several miles away.' Walking was painful as his knee was hurt by the landing. They cleaned his burns and 21 shrapnel holes in his body, using plain crepe paper as bandages. Then he walked to a hospital at Limburg. The greeting POWs received was not friendly. 'Kids kicked and spit on me. The guard wouldn't let them kick my wounded leg, but they could my good one.' That night, the allies struck the hospital. Marvin had no doubt his survival took divine intervention. 'Turning left out of our room, there was nothing but rubble clear to the ground. I turned right, went down the stairs, and found an unexploded bomb had come in the 2nd floor window.' Dec 26, he, four other prisoners, and a German guard left by train. Whenever an air raid sounded, the train stopped and passengers went to a shelter. Once, divine intervention came through an unlikely source: the German guard. 'A Gestapo major wouldn't let the 5 of us in the shelter. After the all-clear, he lined us up to shoot us. I think he singled me out as I was Air Corps and he associated the bombers with me. Looking down the barrel of his Luger, I thought I was a goner. Our guard pulled his gun, and spoke to him. The major put his gun away and the guard said, 'Come!' I wished I had gotten to know him so I could have thanked him.' They were at Frankfort for five, scary days of solitary confinement and grueling interrogation; but he never broke. 'The last day, they told you all about yourself---when you joined the Air Corp, where and when you went to school, where you were stationed in the states, when you came overseas, where you were stationed in France, and a picture of our planes at the base. Had they known my plane's number, they could have pointed to it. It was disappointing as it showed there were spies in the US' records department.' The POWs headed to a transit camp in Wetzler, where he was one of the few not to get frostbite. There, he saw 2 of his crew. One had escaped, but was recaptured. The other had located the crashed plane, found the pilot decapitated, and a 20-millimeter hole through Marvin's chair and radio.","","Mr & Mrs Marvin Geist",""

In his citation, 'He skillfully maneuvered over a Japanese cruiser, and plunging through a deadly barrage in antiaircraft fire from ships and shore batteries, scored a direct hit on the cruiser.' He told me that the bomb went right into the cruiser's smoke stack. The following are some excerpts from Joe's Aviators Flight Log Book. 'November 5th strike on W.

We loaded the trucks, hooked up the guns, we were on alert so we knew something big was about to happen and it did!! D-day on Utah Beach on the Normandy Coast of France....We came to Utah Beach where there were a lot of ships sunk in the water but we had cleared out channels to make it to shore. They opened the front doors and we drove out on the beach to an area away form the water to wait for our connection with the 4th Infantry Division, which we were to be attached to and our battery was to guard 20th Field artillery which were 155 Howitzers.

As it got dark the German planes began to fly over, we were instructed not to fire on them unless our area was being attacked. We were only a few miles form the beach and it was quite a display of fire works going on there. All the tracers going in to the air looked like a long fountain boiling up. The night was quiet for a little while except for some artillery firing and occasional rifle or machine gun fire. Then a lone plane came flying over, I guess he wanted to get rid of his load in a hurry and get out of the area for the next thing I heard was a quick whoosh a bang went off on the other side of hedgerow, throwing dirt and rock all around us. Boy, that sure livened us up and put some pep into our fox hole digging. It wasn't very long until another plane came flying but higher up. The 90mm guns started firing at it and soon a burst set the plane on fire. If you don't think looking up in the sky at night and seeing a big ball of fire coming down on you won't get you on the move...it does!!! I dove into a fox hole and two more bodies landed on top of me. The plane crashed a couple hundred yards away from me. So much for my first night on French soil.'

Charles. I was born in Niota, Illinois in 1919. I spent most of my lift living in Chicago. Born into a railroad family, my grandfather, father and I worked for the Santa Fe Railroad almost all our lives. As I was working for the railroad which was classified as an essential war job, each time I was called up, the Army would defer me and send me back to keep the railroads running. I finally was inducted after a third try! I belonged to the 272nd Regiment, the Battle Axe Regiment, of the famous 'Fighting 69th' Infantry Division. I was part of the Anti-Tank Company. My Fourth Platoon was the demolition or the Mine Platoon. We served in the European Theater of Operations. My job was dangerous, but had to be done. We had to be careful of the anti-personnel mines that were placed around the anti-tank mines. They would jump up in the air and explore in your face. We marked off the small paths we cleared with white tape, so that the tanks knew where to go. I did my basic training at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. We experience boiling hot sun, torrential rains, and damp, penetrating cold. We then sailed from Camp Kilmar, New Jersey, on November 15, 2944, and arrived at bitter cold Lopscombe Corners, east of Salisbury, England, on November 26, 2944. The ocean voyage was calm, but the transport ship was extremely crowded. On January 21, 1945, we went to the front in the Eifel Forest area. Five days later, we had our first casualties from artillery fire. We were quartered in tents and log dugouts, eating K-rations and C-rations out of cans. Tasted just like dog food, but if we were lucky, we could build a small fire and heat the food up in our helmet. Later, when we found our way to Leipzig, we captured the largest railroad station in Germany. When we finally got to the Elbe River, we linked up with the First Russian Ukrainian Army. The Russian women soldiers were just as tough as the men. It seemed to me that every Russian soldier carried a machine gun and a bottle of vodka! ","","Son, John R.

The marine detachment there, under the command of a colonel, was used primarily for guard duty. In October of 1942, I had the opportunity to volunteer for the 4th Marine Raider Battalion, which was being formed under the command of Lt. Col., James Roosevelt, the oldest son of the president. We trained at Camp Pendleton and in February of 1943 we shipped out for Esperito Saneto in the New Hebrides. After several months of training we moved north to Guadalcanal. From there we made raids on Vanqunu and New Georgia in the Solomon Islands. After which we went to Nouvea, New Caledonia and then to Aukland, New Zealand for R&R (rest and relaxation). While in Aukland, I turned myself into the Naval hospital because of malaria and hook worm. During my hospital stay, the battalion moved back to Guadalcanal. When I left Aukland to rejoin it, I was put in a transient outfit on New Caledonia for a few weeks and when I finally made it back to the battalion, they had left for Guam. I rejoined the battalion on Guam after the island had been secured and it was from there that we went to Japan. As the first Marines to land in Japan, we moved into Japanese barracks in Yokosoka Naval Base. That was on August 30, 1945 and in December, I boarded ship for home and my first leave since joining the Corps. I was a regular, not a reserve, and I had extended my four year enlistment by two years on November of 1944 so I had to complete my six years. I opted to finish my enlistment back at Bremerton.

HS, I enlisted in the US Marine Corps Reserve in Chicago, IL on 27 Nov 1939 while a junior. That June, I trained at the Army CMTC, Fort Sheridan, IL. The USMCR placed me on active duty for training in July 1940 at Camp Perry, OH, and promoted me to PFC. On 7 Nov 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a National Emergency and the 9th Battalion of the Marine Corps Reserve was called to active duty. We departed from Chicago for San Diego, arriving on Armistice Day, 11 Nov 1940, where the 9th was integrated into the 2nd Defense Battalion and we were assigned to the 50 Caliber Anti-Aircraft Sect. In Jan, most of us were transferred to the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines, French 75mm Artillery. Now a Corporal, I relocated to Camp Elliott, CA, and in May to E Battery and 75mm Pack Howitzers. On May 31st we boarded navy Transport and sailed through the Panama Canal to Charleston, SC. I left there in late Jun, arriving at Argentia Bay, Newfoundland before sailing to Reykjavik, Iceland, arriving on 7 Jul 1941 with the 1st Marine Brigade. During our nine months in Iceland, we paraded on 16 Aug 1941 for Winston Churchill after his meeting with President Roosevelt at Argentia. On 7 Dec 1941, we were in a ton open truck in a snow storm going on liberty in Reykjavik when all British soldiers we passed kept giving us the 'V' sign and saying 'we are glad you are with us.' When we got to town we heard the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. Mar 20th we again boarded the USS Heywood and returned to New York where I transferred to Camp Elliott, CA as a Sergeant. I was then transferred to the 4th Battalion, 12th Marines, 105mm Howitzers for a short time before being sent to New River, NC on 9 Jul 1942 to F Battery, 2nd Battalion, 12th Marines, 75mm Pack Howitzers. From there, it was live firing of the Pack Howitzers in the Desert at Camp Dunlap, Niland, CA. In Feb we were trucked to San Diego and boarded the SS Lurline, a Matson Liner as part of the 3rd Marine Division. We arrived in Auckland, New Zealand for training until July when we sailed to Guadalcanal, BSI for jungle training. It was here we first experienced Japanese air raids and I was promoted to Platoon Sergeant. Under air attack as we approached the landing beach, a bomber flew over our bow and sank the USS McLean on our port side. Our Survey section was aboard and all but one were saved. We were bombed two nights in a row with no casualties, although we lost one gun and our Galley. The Japanese fired their artillery nightly, but most of it went past us. Promoted to Gunnery Sgt., we sailed back to Guadalcanal in Jan, while the Army took over protecting the airfields. With the Japanese fleet attacking in the battle for Saipan, our D Day was re-scheduled with our landing to be in the 5th wave by transferring our Howitzers to Amphibian Tractors. When none were available, we landed from the LCVPs at the edge of the reef. We had to pile all the parts of the Howitzers and ammunition in the water on the reef and then carry it all to our selected positions; all while under mortar fire. After the Island was secured, we swept it and captured a few stragglers. They were all starving and did not but up any resistance. After my promotion to Warrant Officer, we sailed from Guam with the 3rd Battalion, 21st Marines and my artillery Forward Observer Team was assigned to them for the landing. I spent my 23rd birthday with K Co. onboard the LCVPs. The next day we landed on Red Beach under artillery and mortar fire. By the 5th day, we had captured Airport 2. Two grenades exploded right in front of me and I was slightly wounded in the face, while Capt. R. Heinze had fragments inside his left thigh from the same grenades. After capturing the high ground at the junction of the runways, our team spent the night there under ponchos, directing our artillery under mortar and artillery fire.","","self",""

After being assigned uniforms and supplies, I traveled by railroad troop train to Sheppard Field, Texas, for about six weeks of basic training. I was then taken by bus to the Oklahoma Municipal Airport in Tulsa, OK. There I attended Spartan School of Aeronautics for ten 10-day courses on the various phases of aircraft maintenance. After graduating in the top 10% of the class, I was sent with a group to Barksdale Field near Shreveport, Louisiana to be assigned to the 319 Bomb Group; 440 Bomb Squadron. My group was equipped with the Martin B-26-B planes. Later on September 27, 1947 from New York City harbor we boarded the British ship The Queen Mary for Greenock, Scotland. After traveling by train and later boarding The Moultain, a British Indian boat converted to haul troops. We went ashore in landing barges as part of the North African Invasion force at the port of Arzew, Algiers. Soon after arriving at the Algiers Airport we were assembled as a ground maintenance crew to service planes that lacked ground maintenance crews. It was here that we manually fueled planes using British 5 gallon gas cans that had been shipped two per paper box. Large simple funnels and chamois skin were used to strain the fuel. These planes were in combat, supporting the invasion forces that were liberating the North African area, the British 8th army, and helped liberate the North African area west of Palestine, or the Holy Land.

I was inducted into the Army on July 23, 1943, after having graduated from Abilene (Kansas) High School that spring. Since I had volunteered for the ski troops through the National Ski Patrol Association in New York City, I was immediately assigned to Company E of the 85th Mountain Infantry at Camp Hale, Colorado. Camp Hale was situated at 9,000 feet in the Pando Valley, and was surrounded by mountains ranging up to 14,000 feet. The first several weeks were spent in basic training. Then our mountaineering began which included proper walking, hiking, camping, rock climbing and rappelling. Hiking was done with a ninety pound rucksack and rifle, and when the snow came we added long wooden cross country skis and poles. In June, 1944, the 10th Mountain Division, composed of the 85th, 86th, and 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment and supporting units, was sent to Camp Swift, near Austin, Texas. There the Division added some heavier weapons and we had some 'Flat-land' training and training with Army mules. In December, 1944, the Division was transferred to Virginia where we boarded a ship bound for Naples, Italy. My unit boarded LCI craft for a shorter voyage to Leghorn. The Allied advance had been stalled by German troops who were entrenched in the Apennine Mountains. In the area to which the 10th Mountain was assigned, Mount Belvedere overlooked Highway 64, one of the primary highways between Florence and Bologna. German artillery on Mount Belvedere and a series of peaks named Riva Ridge blocked traffic on the highway. Four other divisions had been unable to dislodge the Germans. Using our mountain training, we took Belvedere on February 19,1945, by sending a battalion of men from the 86th up to the 1500 foot Riva Ridge on ropes, surprising the Germans while other units made frontal assaults. We led the Allies through the remaining Apennines and through the PO Valley, ending in the Italian Alps around Lake Garda. On May 2, 1945, the Germans in Italy surrendered. In 114 days of combat, 992 mountaineers had lost their lives; 4154 were wounded. The 10th Mountain was then sent to occupy the area around Udine to protect it from Yugoslavian troops. In July the 10th was ordered back to the United States for further training in preparation for the invasion of Japan. On August 14, 1945, I walked in the door of my parents' home as President Truman announced the unconditional surrender of Japan. I was honorably discharged on February 8, 1946, after spending my entire wartime service in Company E. I received awards including a Combat Infantry Badge and two Battle Stars.

The US wanted its Navy recruits to be isolated from all world countries (mainly Japan) when they (or we) gathered for our training maneuvers, so they decided to start a boot camp in Farragut, Idaho in a very rugged and isolated area and built a modern training facility high in the jungle area of Idaho. Everyone assumed they would build a Navy training facility somewhere on or near ocean frontage so this jungle atmosphere was very deceiving. From boot camp, I went to Treasure Island, near San Francisco. The ship I was assigned to was launched in San Francisco. I boarded her with my fellow comrades and served as a member of the group assigned on the Captain's Bridge section. We set out to sea and sailed with the 3rd Fleet group of over 100 fighting ships of all specialties. The name of my ship was Lackawanna; it was a fleet tanker. We mainly refueled destroyers, called Destroyer Escorts (Des) and Destroyer Depth Chargers (DDs). The government named tankers after some well-known river in a state. I believe ours was in Pennsylvania. We took off from Frisco, sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge; made a hard left rudder, went between Alcatraz Island (nicknamed 'a Pile of Rocks'). It laid to our port side. We followed the coast line to San Diego and refueled there with diesel fuel and headed seaward toward 'Pearl Harbor,' in Hawaii. We took liberty or shore leave there. My inseparable buddy, Norman Clanton from Dodge City, Kansas, and I took off up the streets. Every 5th or 6th building had recreational facilities for the Fleet. We left Pearl Harbor and sailed. We crossed the Equator so I became a shellback. Incidentally, tankers never operated among the Fleet, or never moved together. Usually there were three tankers operating together. Since the enemy liked to destroy us, if possible, because of our Fleet-saving cargo, 'FUEL,' we operated separately and cruised about 12 to 15 miles behind each other. We also went on a zigzag course; reason---an enemy submarine couldn't set us up too far ahead of time because they never knew exactly where we would be. However, one time, an enemy sub lucked out on the middle tanker. She had just fueled an aircraft carrier with her load of highly explosive airplane fuel, so her empty cargo tanks had nothing but highly explosive fumes in them. She took a torpedo --- so, BOOM! --- nothing left. When the funnel of smoke cleared, nothing there but clear surface. Scared??? I was the gunner on a 40-millimeter quad machine gun. Four of us manned her so we stayed right at 'Battle Station' 24 hours a day. Another hairy incident --- we were moored alongside our mother ship, the Missouri, refueling her, when three hari-kari suicide planes showed up. One dove into our neighboring 400 mm. gun turret. One crashed the front deck where airplane fuel was stored and the third one headed for us. It missed and plunged between the two ships. We saw the pilot eject himself from the fighter and, rather that surrender, he committed 'hari-kari!' (The dummy would have been in 'hog heaven' if he had surrendered.) The weather was treacherous at times. Typhoons were common occurrences. One hit us off Guam and split us right in two. I was on the fantail so we went floating off the other direction. They took us back to Pearl Harbor and as we entered the dry dock they transferred all of us to a new tanker, the Cahaba, so back to sea we went! We rendezvoused at Guam with the 3rd Fleet. In the harbor, we were docked close together. I was assigned 'Coxswain of the Captain's Gig,' a small boat. Our captain's name was Beanblossom (good Irish name??). The writer of comic strip 'Tarzan,' Edgar Rice Burroughs, was a special guest aboard our ship. He was standing on the Captain's Bridge watching as I was attempting to board the Captain's Gig to bring it around for service. A large wave washed me overboard and I crazily fought to climb aboard.","","Sister, Elizabeth Talbott",""

In February, 1943, I received my draft notice. At the time, I was working after school and weekends in a small factory which had converted from making civilian goods to war essential products. I was asked to take a six-month deferment while I trained a woman to do my job. When I finally was inducted in October 1943, I was assigned to the Army Specialized Training Program, which meant that I would take basic Infantry training and then be assigned to Cornell University to continue engineering school to become an Army Engineer. The ATSP program for engineering students was discontinued and since I had infantry training completed, I was assigned to the 343 Inf. Reg, 86th 'Blackhawk' division at Camp Livingston, Louisiana. Here I was acting squad leader and shot expert with the 60 mm Mortar. I volunteered to become a paratrooper and graduated from Jump School at Ft. Bennin, Georgia. After another 5-week course in Parachute Maintenance, I was sent to France, where I was issued an M-1 Rifle, a steel helmet, a 60 mm Mortar, hand grenades, and ammunition that started my combat experience. A highlight of my time served was when we were told to prepare ourselves for a 'spit and polish' review by the Top Brass. On March 15, 1945, we awaited the arrival of Ike and his party. With Eisenhower in the first Jeep was our beloved General Maxwell Taylor. Then came Lt. Gen. Beretan, CG of the First Allied Airborne Army, Major General Ridgeway and Stephan Early, President Roosevelt's Secretary. After reviewing the troops, Ike addressed us. Ike told us that we, the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne had become a fitting symbol on which the United Nations, all the citizens of the United Nations, can say to their soldiers today, 'we are proud of you' as it is my great privilege to say to you man to man to the 101st Division with all its attached units, I am awfully proud of you.

They had no tanks or artillery to support them and walked over 1,000 miles through dense jungles. They disrupted the Japanese supply and communications lines and climaxed their 'behind the lines' operations with the capture of Myitkyina Airfield. This would benefit the supply aircraft that no longer had to fly over “the Hump” to ferry supplies to China. By this time, they had endured four months of marching and combat in the mountains and jungles of Burma. They had to carry all of their equipment on their backs and the backs of pack mules.

Nearly 60 years have gone by and Asher Coleman still has trouble talking about his experience in World War II. Coleman fought in General George Patton's Army as part of the 93rd Recon Squadron as a scout section sergeant. He served in the Army for three years and three months. His job as part of the recon division was to drive ahead and draw fire from the Germans, then fall back and allow the rest of the Army to fight. 'I was fortunate,' Coleman said, referring to his safe return from the war. 'I was pretty fortunate.' The highlight of Coleman's military career was his capture of a German general and about 150 soldiers. As Coleman described the event, he said he saw white flags waving up the hill. As he approached, he noticed it was a general in a German army, along with his staff of about 150 men. They were surrendering to U.S. forces because they thought they were about to be captured by the Russians. Asher said he parked his Jeep and had the soldiers throw their guns in the river. He had each soldier place his pistol inside his Jeep. When asked if he still had the one of the collector's items, Asher said he traded the pistol he had taken home for fishing equipment. The modest Colman insisted that he was just in the right place at the right time to make the capture. 'The commander gives you the order and tells you where to go,' Coleman said. The 60th anniversary of D-Day was June 6, 2004. Asher recalled he was in Texas at the time of the actual D-Day. He didn't go to war until December 1944. When asked what his fondest memory of his time in the military, Coleman said, 'When I got the orders to come home'. Coleman also recalled a fond memory of his time with the 93rd Recon basketball team. To this day, he still keeps in touch with Phil Ayers, the youngest player on their team. Coleman recalled a time he and his division came upon a couple of German soldiers at the top of the hill. The soldiers ran and left their weapons behind. Asher and his division went to destroy the weapons with explosive charges as a standard procedure. What he didn't realize was that the soldiers had already put charges in the guns and destroyed their own guns. About that time, Lieutenant Dayhoff came over the hill and commended Coleman and his division. Coleman said he took credit for the deed. It was not until some 40 years after the war at a reunion that Coleman shared the secret with Dayhoff. When the war in Europe ended, Coleman was back in the United States on a 45-day furlough. 'We were headed for Japan when we got the news (when Japan surrendered ending the war in the Pacific Theater),' Coleman said. ","","Dorthey R. Coleman",""

He was sent to the Quartermaster Replacement Training Center at Fort Warren (near Cheyenne), Wyoming, where he was an officer with Company 'C', 2nd Quartermaster Training Regiment, for two years. After being promoted to the rank of Captain in charge of an all-black bakery company, he was sent with his men to Britain in early 1944, where he memorably arrived by ship on the river Clyde and sailed into the port of Glasgow, Scotland. His company then traveled by black-out train to England, where they were encamped for a number of months on the Norfolk estate of an English aristocrat. The bakery company subsequently moved to Somerset in the west of England, where they learned to operate mobile bread bakery units, which had been invented in England. After the D-Day invasion of 6 June 1944, Hendershott and his men pitched their tents at an aviation base in Normandy, in northern France, where they baked thousands of loaves of bread every day, to feed the Allied troops, who were by then pushing the Germans out of France. Hendershott's bakery company spent a whole year living in their tents, in deep snow during the winter months, that winter of 1944-45 being the coldest in living memory. He recalled that German prisoners of war, who were being held nearby, dug holes in the ground in which they sunk their tents in order to keep warm, and succeeded in their endeavor. The ingenuity and energy of these German prisoners were much admired by Hendershott. Although he was not engaged in combat, Herman Hendershott vividly remembers Christmas Eve 1944, when German fighter planes attempted to bomb his bakery company and a nearby aviation base as well. The mobile bakery units survived without any damage, as did the bakers and their commander. Hendershott acquired a pet cat during his time in Normandy, which he had to leave behind when he departed the European Theater. He also made many friends in the local French community, including a doctor and his wife, Monsieur and Madame Prevost, whom he visited again in 1971 with his wife and eldest daughter. After the capitulation of the Germans (V-E Day) on 8 May 1945, Herman Hendershott was invited by the mayor of Boos, the little town near Rouen where he was stationed, to attend the ceremony in celebration of the end of hostilities, on 18 May 1945, as the local church and then at the local Monument to the Dead. Hendershott's eldest daughter has in her possession the invitation, hand-written in elegant calligraphy, addressed to 'monsieur le Capitaine, Base aviation, Boos'. Hendershott was discharged from active duty and returned to his family (by then he had three small daughters) and his law practice in Eugene, Oregon, in the United States, during the early autumn of 1945.

They had 1,200 to 1,500 pounds of TNT in netting above our heads. If they'd ever hit that, we'd have hit the moon! I was 30, married, and running my own trucking business when I was drafted. I was drafted from Garnett, where I still live today, in Feb 1943. I got on the Santa Fe, rode into Fort Leavenworth and was inducted into the Army. They ran us around about half-naked and I got the flu. I was in the hospital for 2 or 3 days; then they sent me back. I probably had training better than most of my buddies as my wife, Ruby, stayed about 40 miles from where the 149th was training. When word came down that we would be leaving for Ft Pierce, FL, she made plans to get our car. I told her not to, by she said, 'I'm going to get that car!' We went to Florida early with the cook's wife, in our car! When we got there, we went swimming in the ocean. That was the most fun we'd ever had in our lives. On 29 Dec 1943, I left New York. I can always remember the Statue of Liberty just getting lower and lower, and my heart sinking with it. I didn't think I'd ever see the US again. Even though I'd been a trucker in civilian life and had already painted Ruby's name on the Jeep I'd been assigned, in England someone decided they needed me to ride a motorcycle instead. I told that fella that I'd never even had a bicycle when I was a kid, but he said to ride it anyway. I gave it gas, went through a lady's yard, tore up her victory garden, and hit the side of the house. That fella came walking over and said, 'We don't need you!' I had never gambled, but one night I got in on a craps game and cleaned them out. I won $83 and sent it home to my wife. I lived on $13 a month the whole time I was in the military. We left England on 5 June, but the channel was so rough we had to turn back. The captain of our boat had been at Anzio and Salerno (two previous beach landing battles in Italy). He said, 'I'll put you boys in; don't worry about that.' They gave us chicken soup to eat, but the sea was so rough it wasn't too long before all that soup was in the bottom of the boat! I didn't throw up though; I stayed with mine. All of a sudden, the USS Texas veered off in a different direction and that big battleship turned sideways. Those guns went off, and you could just see that big ship rocking. They put our ramp down and we went off in water up to our chest. We were in the second wave to land on Omaha Beach and a huge portion of the first hadn't even made it out of the water. It wasn't like the movies, where they come running off the ramp � we were crawling. It was the most horrible thing you'd ever seen. More bodies than you can imagine. Later, we ran into snipers. They were just shooting and shooting from concrete bunkers. One of our guys got a bulldozer and just went down through there, covering them up. The Germans weren't the only ones we buried with the dozers though. The allied death toll from the landings had been so high that we had to dispose of the bodies by digging huge trenches and putting the bodies in. Once the fighting had moved further inland, those soldiers were exhumed and moved to permanent graves on higher ground, where they're still buried today. I've forgotten a lot of it, but a lot of it I remember at night. Our direct engagement with enemy forces during the invasion � far beyond our duties as engineers � earned us a special commendation from General Eisenhower.

That was supposed to be a four-month training session, but it was cut back to three months because they needed more bodies to fight in Europe. In December of 1944, I was sent on the Queen Elizabeth overseas to Europe and I entered the fighting in the retaking of the Battle of the Bulge. I entered the battle as a machine gunner in the infantry squad, and then volunteered to transfer to the tank battalion. Tankers needed replacements as they were being killed, so they were taking from the infantry battalions. I was getting tired of digging a foxhole every night to try to sleep in. It was freezing cold. All of that made the tank sound pretty good to me, so I volunteered to be a gunman on the tank. Soon I became a tank driver. The tank wasn't much better than being in the infantry. There was no heat in the tanks. I did battle from the tanks from January 1945 until the war ended. We fought for thirty-some little towns that had to be taken back, and we pushed the Germans back across the Rhine River until they surrendered. I was hit and wounded on March 15 by shrapnel while refueling the tank. I was sent to the first aid station where they patched me up and sent me back out to work.

During the following months of training and waiting, Cal met his future wife Betty Beatrice Bennett at a church dance. Cal was sent to France on June 8, 1944. He left so suddenly that he never had a chance to say goodbye to Betty. Cal had run all the way to the Bennett home when he found out he was leaving, but Betty had gone to the movies. For the next 14 months, Cal followed the ground troops across France, Belgium and Germany, first with the 1st Army Headquarters, and then with the 17th Signal Battalion. His responsibility was to receive and send messages to the field. Cal's worst memories of the war were seeing the evidence of the Holocaust and the devastation that the war had brought to these beautiful countries. Cal was sent home on leave July 1, 1945, and arrived in New York on July 10, 1945. He was only home for a short time and was to be deployed to the Pacific after training in Texas.

October 16, 1943: Arrived at harbor of Naples. Tied up along side of the passenger ship terminal which was Mussolini's pride and joy, but now in ruins. US military dragging the waters along the Pier bringing up weapons which the Germans had thrown in as they retreated.
June 5, 1944: Underway to France from Weymouth in convoy. Expected enemy action. None encountered.
June 6, 1944: D-Day. Ships and landing crafts of every type motionless on every side. We were stopped. Over shore could be seen a curtain of flares and the occasional burst of gunfire. Fires were burning along the hill. Peculiar fireworks over beach. Seemed to be raining red, white and blue bits of fire. Kept waiting for word of landing of troops. No sign of enemy aircraft. Dawn came and at 0630 word came of landing of first wave. Saw LCT 85 in sinking condition. Later received word of second landing. Enemy firing on beach all day. LCI on beach hit. Warships shelling all the time. Found bodies in water. Several sticks of bombs dropped on beach.
June 8, 1944: Small enemy air attacks all over anchorage at nightfall. Broached and cropped LCTs, LCIs, LSTs and small craft can be seen high and dry on the beach. Allied planes overhead all day. Unloading went very well. Occasional shelling by warships.
June 9, 1944: Pretty hot. Enemy air attack on anchorage at nightfall. Think they hit one or two ships. Some claim 3 or 4 planes went down. Secured about 0100. No further action. Slept the best I have in some time. Report Germans using gas at front lines.
June 10, 1944: About 0115, German planes returned. Nothing dropped nor was there any strafing. We wasted a lot of ammo. Just before dawn sound of aircraft overhead kept us on alert. Word came that plane was friendly to cease firing. Almost immediately afterward saw plane go down in flames over horizon. Afraid it was one of ours shot down by enemy aircraft fire. Around 0700 formation of B-26s flew over. Reports of women snipers coming in. Nothing more so far concerning gas. Planes landing on air strip on hill behind beach. Saw DUKW hit mine on beach. Also saw lines of prisoners coming down to beach approximately 200-300. Beach really cluttered by disabled landing craft. One LCT completely upside down and another buckled a mid ship. LCTs still on beach high and dry. Saw LT Bob Smith. Glad he survived so far. ","","Wife, Betty; Brother Joe Culbreath; and children, Jim, Rick, LeeAnn, Denise, Charise",""

I had been sent out to Burma (after a big fight with a group from the Quartermaster Corps). After I flew one mission with Air Evacuation, my commanding officer, from South Texas, agreed that for his reputation and my safety, it would be wise for me to be transferred to Burma immediately. So, the transfer orders were to be Vocal Order of Commanding General (VOCO). The orders were not written out --- I was not court marshaled --- and didn't get my pay for 60 days. The timing was not in my favor. After Ike took over in the European Group --- the General I was under made a deal that those of us that flew over 'The Hump' almost every day to China for the Mercenaries (Flying Tigers), would be entitled to one week of Rest & Recuperation (R and R) for every 25 missions. After 50 missions, a trip and furlough to the U.S. was given. Ike took over and Lord Louis (relative of the Queen) was to be in charge of the CBI Theater. I had just counted my 50 China missions so guess what I got --- I was assigned to Lord Louis' airplane. I told Headquarters that I didn't want that job, so they let me crew for USO Troops until a 'war weary' would be available to take us to the U.S. Nine months later, I came back to the U.S. to ride on a 'war weary airplane.' You had to take only the least amount of weight possible. When I left Casablanca, I handed in everything --- all personal belongings --- pictures --- my '45' pistol --- my parachute. The clothes were pants with legs cut off at knee level, no underwear except T-shirt, my flying coveralls and a pair of shoes. The plane made it to the Azores. I got a ride from there to Newfoundland on a British transport, then on to New York City on Pan-American Airlines.

I trained on the 37 caliber and 57 caliber antitank weapons and the 50 caliber machine gun at Fort Hood, Texas. From there I was sent to California and was shipped to the south Pacific. We crossed the equator then back to Manila Bay. From there I joined the 37th Infantry Division, 145th Infantry DCO, and the 30 caliber machine gun squad. We left Manila and went north on patrols into the mountains to find the Japanese. We fought up through Cagayan Valley to the north end of the island, blowing up their ammunition dumps and captured the rest of the Japanese army that were on the island. We chased them that far while still in the 37th Division. Then we moved back to our camp and the division went home. I didn't have enough points to go home with them so I was transferred to the artillery outfit. The outfit was stationed at Cabanato where we were on guard duty for the company. This was also the prison camp at the end of the death march so we dug up the graves of allied prisoners killed during the march. The bodies were then taken back to Manila for burial. I was shipped back to Honolulu and put into the Air Force for 4 months. The infantry and the Air Force didn't get along very well. On the first day of inspection, a 2nd Lieutenant told me to take off my infantry combat badge. I then said 'over my dead body would I take it off'. We never had an inspection again all the time we were in Honolulu. I came home to Camp Beil, California for discharge, then back to Junction City, Kansas. The best birthday present I had was on August 6, 1945 when the bomb was dropped on Japan and the War ended.

'You never forget that (D-Day).' Back on June 6, 1944, Deam was a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne. Just 19 years old and still in high school when he enlisted, Deam stood 6 feet talk, weighed 124 pounds and measured 24 inches around his waist. By the time he and other soldiers prepared to meet Nazi forces in the daring D-Day invasion, the U.S. Army first sergeant was known as 'General Toothpick.' Don Deam recalled that when veterans first came home, people didn't seem to want to hear the war stories. So he just put them behind him as a piece of history that was little discussed for years. But he has since been recording his memories from the past; calling war buddies to confirm his recollections. Among the passages Deam has written is one in which General Dwight D. Eisenhower visited with soldiers before D-Day. Eisenhower, who grew up in Abilene, Kansas, asked if any of the men were from Kansas. Another man pushed Deam forward. Although he grew up in Florida, Deam was born in Kansas and his parents were living in Manhattan. He remembers Eisenhower shaking his hand. Then he laid his hand on my shoulder and said 'Come back son'. Deam remembers flying toward France, seeing the white cliffs of Dover slip out of sight as his plane left the United Kingdom. Then he remembers the anti-aircraft and machine gun fire; the way the tracer bullets glowed red as they flew past. He remembers the bullets that ripped through his right arm after he hit the ground and fighting for days despite the injury. The night before they left for D-Day, his colonel gave a rousing speech from the hood of a Jeep. This was what they had been waiting for, the men were told. And at that moment, Deam was scared. His legs felt like rubber. 'I didn't want them to see me' he said of the men he commanded. 'I was the first sergeant.' So I walked behind my tent, threw myself on the ground and prayed. I didn't ask God to save me from being hurt or killed; I asked God to give me the courage to manage fear and guide me so I could do what a first sergeant was supposed to do in combat. On D-Day, he understood what it meant to be at war. 'This sounds like a ridiculously stupid statement,' he said, 'I wasn't scared'. By the time the war ended, Deam had earned a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. Near the end of his duty, he took a piece of Adolph Hitler's stationary from the dictator's Eagles Nest residence and wrote home. 'My warring days and parachute jumps are about over, and I'm not in the least bit sorry.', he wrote to his parents and siblings. 'All of my friends are gone.' After the war, Deam went on to get married and have two children. He worked for 35 years as an attorney.

He graduated from Felt Oklahoma High School and was drafted when he turned 18. He decided he wanted to be in the Army, taking specialized tests for access to additional military benefits, however when he arrived at the draft office in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma he was put into the Marines. They listed him officially as drafted, discharged and then enlisted, all on the same day of January 19, 1944 so he would be enlisted, not drafted. He was sent to boot camp in San Diego for 6 weeks and then his unit was assigned to stay another month for mess duty. He then went to communication school, afterwards was send to Camp Pendleton for combat training and then got sent back to San Diego and was shipped out to Hawaii shortly after. While in boot camp, he qualified as a Marksman on the M1 rifle, which earned him $5 more per month in pay. After boot camp he was stationed at Camp Caitlin in Oahu, Hawaii in a temporary tent city between Honolulu and Pearl Harbor. On December 25th, 1944 he boarded a troopship and arrived on February 19th, 1945 to begin his first tour of duty and start the invasion of Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands. He was wounded in action on February 23rd, 1945 when a mortar shell landed 10 feet from the fox hole he was in and went underground and burned him in the face, right arm and hands. He was transported to the hospital and was told to stay inside for a week due to the visibility of his white bandages, which caused him to work on the field telephone switchboard and manned the ship to shore radio teletype. There were two American flags raised on Iwo Jima, and Everett helped the infantry man put the flag in his backpack who raised the first flag. He told Everett that he was going to put the flag on top of the hill (Mount Suribachi). After two to three weeks, he made it to the top, and tied the flag to the butt of his rifle and put the bayonet end in the sand, however, just as he did that a Japanese soldier crawled out of his cave with a hand grenade and that was the end of the infantry man and his flag. Later, Everett witnessed the second famous raising of the American flag on Mount Suribachi. He was about 200 yards down below it and he looked and said 'look there that d*** fool is putting up a flag.’ When he looked back he could see a little more clearly that there were five men instead of one. He later learned one of those five men was a Navajo when he met that Navajo’s grandson. On March 16, 1945 he left Iwo Jima and travelled by troopship back to Maui, Hawaii until after the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan and boarded troopships back to Japan. He went ashore Japan on September 22, 1945 and served again stringing telephone wire until January 4th, 1946. He then was sent to China from January 7th, 1946 until April 8th, 1946 to prepare it for occupation. He stayed in former Japanese barracks the six months he was in Japan and in China. His job was still to string telephone wire during both of these times on Japan and China. His battalion job’s was disarmament to get the Japanese out and prepare the islands for occupation by Army troops which would arrive later. On April 8th he boarded another troopship to bring him home. He was awarded the Purple Heart and was Honorably Discharged on May 8th, 1946. On the day he was discharged he was awarded his Corporal status. In the total of the 20 months he served, 6 months of it was spent on the troopships on the sea traveling.

D. 21st Bn. 7th Infantry Regiment with the Infantry Replacement Training Command (IRTC) as a Drill Instructor at FT. McClellan near Anniston, Alabama. There he met and married Ellen Jane Pope. They remained married throughout their lives. In 1944 he was assigned to Co. D 93rd Bn. 24th Infantry Regiment, again with the IRTC as a Drill Instructor at Camp Maxey near Paris, Texas. He was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, WW 2 Victory Medal, and the American Campaign Medal. He was discharged on November 19th, 1945 at the Detachment School at Ft. Bliss, Texas. As a boy, whenever I would ask my dad what he did during the war, he would softly and simply say that 'he did not fight in the war, but he helped train those men who were going to fight overseas'. He said that he was 'proud' to train men knowing the training that he, and men like my father, provided might 'help keep the boys alive and bring them home'. After the war, he moved his family to Detroit, Michigan looking for work as did thousands of veterans 'from the South' seeking a better way of life in the automobile factories. He went to work at General Motors and retired after 30 years due to his health. Artel passed away in 1982 after losing a tough battle with cancer. He is missed dearly by his sons Keith, Artel Jr. aka Ike, David and Michael, all of whom are veterans and served proudly in the US Army. He is remembered by all of his family and those who knew him not only for being a great dad, grandpa, and great grandpa, but for being a gentle, kind man, and a proud veteran who loved his country dearly.

He was the first child of John and Elizabeth Iseli. In 1929, the family moved to a farm near Industry, KS. He attended Greenridge Grade School and graduated from Dickinson County Community High School in 1942. He did farm work until he was drafted into the Army on August 3, 1944. He began his Army training at Ft. Leavenworth. From there he went to Camp Hood, Texas, where he concluded his training in December of 1944. Following that, he reported to Ft. Ord, California in January 1945; then Ft. Lawton, Washington, where he shipped out on January 22nd. He arrived at the Hawaiian Islands on January 29 and remained there until February 16th. He landed in the Philippines on March 4th and joined the 96th Division, Company B, 382nd Infantry. After 22 days, on March 26, he left for Okinawa and made the invasion of Okinawa on April 1, 1945. Three days later, on April 4th, he was wounded by a Japanese machine gun. On April 5th, he left Okinawa on a hospital ship and landed in Saipan on April 15th, where he was treated at the 369th Station Hospital. After nearly two months in the Saipan hospital, John returned to active duty on June 12, 1945. On July 27th, he left Okinawa for the Philippines and landed in Mindoro in August 11th. In early January 1946, the 96th Division came home but John did not have enough points, so he stayed in the Philippines. On January 3, 1946, he left Mindoro and went to Luzon and joined the 786th Ordinance, 86th Division. On July 20, 1946, he went to the Repple Depple and on August 12th, he boarded a ship to come home. He landed at Camp Beale, California on August 28th and was discharged from the Army on October 28, 1946 with a rank of Technician 5th Grade. John spent part of his time overseas doing mechanic work as he had passed the mechanic test when he was first in the Army but at the time, infantry men were needed more than mechanics. He said that when there weren't things to fix, he and the men, he worked with, spent their time building cars and other vehicles out of spare parts. Although not all of his memories are good ones, he easily and fondly recalls the men that he lived and worked with. John received several medals for his service during World War II including the Philippine Liberation Medal with a Bronze Battle Star, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with a Bronze Battle Star, the WWII Victory Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Purple Heart, the Philippine Independence Ribbon, the Bronze Star, and a Combat Infantry Badge. In addition to these, he has recently received a certificate for a Unit Citation for the 96th Infantry Division. John's World War II service was a very important part of his life however he has also had a full life at home with his family. A few years after coming home, John met and married Imogene Robinett on May 15, 1949. They have spent their married life in the rural communities of Industry and Abilene, KS. They had four children: Nancy in 1951, Joan in 1954, Wilma in 1957 and Terry in 1969. John farmed after returning from the Army until 1964 when he started driving a truck in addition to farming. In 1970, he quit farming to drive a truck full time. In 1975, he started driving for Churchill Truck Line, where he continued until 1985 when he retired from trucking for health reasons. During his trucking days, he traveled all over the Eastern half of the United States. Since retiring John has spent time with his growing family. John and Imogene have four children, nine grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren. He is a lifetime member of several organizations, including the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars), the American Legion and the DAV (Disabled Veterans of America). Part of his free time has been spent volunteering at the Dickinson County Historical Society, where he served as a member of the board of trustees for several years. Woodworking projects are also something that he is known for. ","","The family of John Iseli, Jr.",""

During the Great Depression, his family moved into the basement of their small frame house and rented out the main floor. He took many odd jobs as a boy, including as a soda jerk. Graduating high school in 1941, he enrolled in the University of Kansas, earning a coveted spot on the Jayhawks' basketball team and joining the Kappa Sigma fraternity. His studies interrupted by WWII, Bob joined the Army's Enlisted Reserve Corps and was trained as an anti-tank gunner. After officer candidate training, he was appointed a Second Lieutenant in the 10th Mountain Division as platoon leader. On Apr 14, 1945, his company ran into intense enemy fire while attempting to take Hill 913 in Northern Italy. Witnessing his radioman go down, he jumped up and pulled his lifeless form into the foxhole. Jumping out again, he was hit in the back by German machine-gun fire. After waiting nine hours on the battlefield for evacuation, he was not expected to live. Extensive wounds paralyzed his right arm. Bob began his recovery at the Percy Jones General Hospital in Battle Creek, MI. It now houses federal offices and is known as the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center, named for him and two fellow disabled veterans. Twice decorated for heroism, Bob received two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star Medal with combat 'V' for valor. Knowing the family did not have the funds, his hometown of Russell raised the money for his operations and rehabilitation. Later, clear he would never realize his boyhood dream of becoming a doctor, he set new goals to study law and give back to the people who had done so much during his four year recovery. Bob attended the University of Arizona from 1948-1951 and earned his law degree from Washburn University in 1952. With no memorial dedicated to those who served in WWII, he sought to make sure an appropriate monument was built before too many more of the 'greatest generation' passed away. As President of the WWII Memorial Commission, he was active in fundraising and building public support. He also served one term in the state legislature, four as Russell County Attorney, four in the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate from 1968-1996, was President Ford's 1976 running mate, and the 1996 Republican presidential candidate. In 1996 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. After retiring from public office, he re-entered private law practice. Dole has written several books, including one on jokes told by the Presidents of the United States, in which he ranks them according to their level of humor, and also published his biography, 'One Soldier's Story: A Memoir.' On July 22, 2003, the Bob Dole Institute of Politics was dedicated on the University of Kansas campus in Lawrence. Former Sen. Bob Dole received the Congressional Gold Medal on January 17, 2018, in recognition of his service to the nation as a 'soldier, legislator and statesman.” Although he left the Army as a captain, in 2019 Congress voted to promote Dole to Colonel in honor of his service. Bob has been married to former U.S. Senator Elizabeth Hanford Dole since 1975. During his Ike's Soldiers interview, Dole stated, 'Eisenhower was my personal hero.'","","The Eisenhower Foundation","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUHNd6t10vk; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e32ftL9Mdls; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPEKjyMhjiY"

I was stationed on Attu Island, as part of Fleet Wing 8, #139 Bomber Squadron, as an AMM 2nd Class PO, flight engineer. Our mission was reconnaissance and bombing. We were on a 700 mile bombing run from Attu Island, Alaska, to the Northern tip of Japan, in 1943 or 1944. On our first bombing run we dispersed several boxes of hand personnel bombs through the flair chute onto our target, a Japanese runway. Circling around to take another strike on the runway to dump our 500 pound bombs on them, suddenly a hurricane took our airplane away from us, directly into Siberia, Russia. During this entrance into Russia we had no control over the plane, which was covered in ice. We dove so fast once I floated around the airplane like an astronaut. Our two pilots fought the controls to no avail, unable to take the plane out of the storm until we were well into Siberia. After taking a survey of the damage, still in flight, we discovered we had lost both of our generators one off each engine they had packed with ice and shorted out. We had also lost all our 40 volt electric circuit radio, radar, and top turret gun included. The pilots decided we would fly as high as we could over Russia since we didn't know our exact location; this would give us the ability to observe the area in case we were attacked as a bandit plane. Our two crew navigators figured out our location by using a ship sexton and put us on a flight course back toward Attu. Recognizing we were low on gasoline we began to throw things out of the airplane including radar, radio, armor plating, bombs, attached gasoline tanks, or anything that wiggled got pitched out the door to lighten the load which would extend our gasoline. After crossing the Bering Straits we picked up another storm in the Attu area. When we broke out of the storm we found ourselves about 5 feet off of our own runway. Upon our landing on the runway we had 3 Base Protection P38 fighters coming off the runway to take out our bandit bomber, by orders. Approaching us, propeller to propeller, the three fighters buzzed over the top of our bomber. All of the crew was interrogated separately as to where we had been all day. My interrogator asked if we had found a landing field and had a picnic. I told him to take the film out of our wings, to find out where we had been. On returning the bomber to the shop I told the A & R Chief what I threw out of the airplane. His remark was what did you do that for; I had to make a report and put it all back!

This was the location to which General MacArthur returned on October 20, 1944, after abdicating the Philippines in March, 1942. As I stood watching, I saw General MacArthur wade ashore to reclaim the Philippines. Tacloban was briefly the seat of the Philippine Commonwealth Government, from October 20, 1944 to February 27, 1945 and was a port city, with ship unloading facilities, so it was constantly a target for Japanese planes, which bombed us regularly. When they ran out of bombs, the Kamikaze pilots would fly their planes directly into the target. Our Naval Construction Battalion, 'The Seabees' was involved in the initial invasion of Leyte Island, at Tacloban. We lived in foxholes, which we dug ourselves, for what seemed a long time. It was, in fact, only a few weeks until our camp was built then we lived in them. Our job as 'Seabees' was to rebuild the airstrip, which was pockmarked from bombs, and to enlarge the dock area. Our secondary effort was to build miles of roads (where there were none) to carry supplies to outlying command posts. A big, tin manila hemp warehouse was adjacent to the dock area, where a Japanese sniper had taken cover inside behind some rolls of hemp. His goal was to kill as many dock workers as possible. He failed. I now have his rifle. I am proud to have served my Country, and my goal is to be the oldest surviving World War II Veteran. ","","Darlene Johnston",""

After finishing school I was sent back to Camp Swift, Texas and transferred to 1476 Engineers Maintenance Company. From there, I was shipped to Boston Massachusetts and boarded a troop ship leaving the US on 2/7/45 and arrived in South Hampton, England on 2/16/45, seasick all the way. I was in England for two months and lived in a tent city with cold rain and mud. We were all wondering what was coming next, and if we would be sent into battle. I left there and crossed the English Channel to LeHarve, France where very little homes, business or anything was left standing. We picked up equipment here (trucks, Jeeps, etc.). It was February, very cold and wet and had to live in tents with a lot of the men becoming ill. Leaving LeHarve, we traveled by truck through Belgium and Holland into Germany. We saw many dead cows and horses in this area and we thought the German army killed them so the villagers could not use them for food or work. It took days to cover the distance and we lived on the trucks. In Germany our company occupied a big warehouse building thought to have been used by the German army. We stayed there until the war ended in Germany. We were then moved to Camp Camel, France near the Mediterranean Sea. We just 'hung out,' waiting for a ship to carry us somewhere in the South Pacific. While we were waiting, the war in Japan ended and we were sent back to the US from Marseille, France across the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic. We arrived September 9, 1945 and I was sick again for the whole 9 day trip. I was overseas for seven months. When we got back to the US I got a 45-day furlough and came home by bus. My furlough was soon over and another soldier and I drove back in his 1934 Ford to Camp White, Oregon near Medford, Oregon. Not too long after that I got another 45-day furlough so another soldier from Knoxville, Tennessee and I decided to hitchhike home. We got two different rides as far as Flagstaff, Arizona then we decided to catch a bus the rest of the way home. I got married to Annie Mae Simmons and it was another awfully short 45 days. I got back to Camp White, Oregon and a detachment of men were sent to Fort Ord, California to prepare a field for B-25 and B-29 bombers to be parked as they came back from over seas. After this assignment was finished we went back to Camp White. I was assigned to dispatch 10 trucks at a time every 15 minutes. It took about four hours to get them all on the road. We were escorted through Portland, Oregon by police on our way to Fort Lewis, Washington. I stayed at Fort Lewis until I was sent back to Fort Brag, North Carolina to be discharged on May 7, 1946. I never had to see battle, and I am very thankful for that, but it was an experience I will never forget. ","","Wife, Frankie Joyce; Children: Sandra, Kim & Laura",""

Named for his maternal grandfather, John Francis Fitzgerald, but known as Jack, he was the second of nine children, 4 boys and 5 girls. In 1936 he followed his older brother Joe, Jr. to Harvard. Jack was commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve on Sep 25, 1941 and assigned to Washington, D.C. As a Lieutenant, he was sent to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Two at Guadalcanal. Assuming command of PT-109 on Apr 25, 1943, Lt. Kennedy had a crew of twelve men whose mission was to stop Japanese ships from delivering supplies to their soldiers. The evening of Aug 1, 1943, his crew left Rendova Harbor to patrol the waters looking for enemy ships to sink. Suddenly, they came upon a Japanese destroyer, the Amagiri (meaning Heavenly Mist) traveling at full speed and headed straight at them. Lt. Kennedy attempted to swerve out of the way, but the much larger ship rammed PT-109, splitting it in half and killing two of his men. The others managed to jump off as their boat went up in flames. Jack was slammed hard against the cockpit, injuring his back. One of his crew members, Patrick McMahon, had terrible burns on his face and hands and wanted to give up. In the darkness, Jack found McMahon and hauled him back to where the others were clinging to a piece of the boat. At sunrise, Jack led his men toward a small island 3 miles away. Despite his own injuries, he towed McMahon ashore by clenching a strap from McMahon's life jacket between his teeth. Six days later, two native islanders found them and went for help, delivering a message Jack had carved into a piece of coconut shell. For his heroism, courage and leadership, he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. He was then given command of PT-59 until Jan 1944, when he was sent as an instructor to the Naval Training Center in Miami, FL. After a spinal operation, he was retired from the Navy Mar 1, 1945. Jack considered becoming a teacher or writer, but his father convinced him to enter politics; he served 6 years in Congress and 8 years in the Senate. Jack was sworn in as the 35th President on Jan 20, 1961 and then assassinated on Nov 22, 1963.

Eisenhower was born in Denison, TX, on October 14, 1890. The Eisenhower family returned to Kansas when he was less than two years old. Young Ike grew up in Abilene, KS, where his boyhood home stands today. Eisenhower entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY, in June 1911 and graduated with the Class of 1915.

Second Lieutenant Eisenhower's first assignment was at Fort Sam Houston, TX. In the years that followed Eisenhower's duties included the Army's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy, the Tank Corps, the American Battle Monuments Commission, and training recruits for World War I. In 1916, he married Mamie Geneva Doud in Denver CO.
His Panama service (1922-24) introduced him to General Fox Conner who took him under his wing and encouraged him to read widely in history, military science, and philosophy and was instrumental in Eisenhower's acceptance by the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, KS. Eisenhower graduated first in the 1926 class of 245 officers.
After assignments in the War Department (1929-35), he accompanied Gen. Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines as an assistant military advisor; his principal duty was training the Filipino Army. After returning to the U.S. in 1940, Ike made his reputation as a great tactician in the U.S. Army's Louisiana Maneuvers of September 1941.

Following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Brig. General Eisenhower was placed in charge of plans for the Pacific Theater by Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall. Two months later, Marshall promoted him to chief of the War Plans Division where he received his second star. In June 1942, Marshall sent Eisenhower to England on a special mission to build cooperation among the Allies as Commanding General, U.S. Army, European Theater. Eisenhower arrived in England on June 24, 1942, and except for a brief stateside visit in January 1944, he was separated from his family until June 1945, following the end of the war in Europe. He served as Commanding General of Allied Forces Europe and planned and oversaw the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, June 6th, 1944. Eisenhower was promoted to 5-star rank in December 1944. He accepted the surrender of the Nazi Germany on V-E Day, May 7, 1945.

General Eisenhower served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from November 1945 until February 1948. He resigned from the Army on February 7, 1948 to serve as president of Columbia University in New York City. In 1950, at President Truman's request, Eisenhower took a leave of absence from Columbia to serve in Paris, France, as the first commanding general of the newly formed North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). On June 1, 1952, Eisenhower returned to the United States to announce his candidacy President of the United States.

Dwight D. Eisenhower served as our 34th President from January 1953-January 1961. Eisenhower died on March 28, 1969 and is buried in the Place of Meditation on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene KS. ","","Eisenhower Foundation",""

We were billeted in various houses around the area and HQ was at Bishopsgate House. When qualified up to A111 standard, we were formed into sections for service abroad (P-permanent, M-mobile). 20M section was formed in early March 1944 and took part in various fund raising exhibitions such as 'Spitfire Week,' War Weapons Week etc. In early June 1944 we were posted to 5 HQ Signals, whose HQ was in Putney. We were just in time for the V1attacks on London and spent some weeks digging out people from Buzz Bombed houses. In early August 1944 we were moved to Southampton where we boarded a 'Liberty' ship and were taken to Omaha Beach where our trucks and equipment were craned over the side on to a 'Rhino' landing barge and we went down a rope ladder on to the barge. This was at St. Laurent sur Mer. We set up station at Jullouville, the temporary HQ was then at Granville. We operated from Jullouville until Paris was liberated, then we moved up to Versailles and were located in the Petites Ecuries, of the Palace of Versailles. During this period, we really did not know the nature of the traffic we were handling. Only after the war did we find out that we were handling the 'Enigma' code traffic with Bletchley Park. Around Christmas time 1944 during the 'Battle of the Bulge' in the Ardennes the traffic and activity was very intense - a truck full of 'OU's (most immediate classification) as we described it. In Jan 1944, I was reassigned, as an experienced operator, to a 'rookie' section, 30M. We were sent to 21 Army Group in Brussels where we operated for some weeks. After various moves throughout France, Germany, and Luxembourg, we were posted to an American Camp at Weimar. I'm not 100% sure, but I think it was the 2nd Armoured Division. We spent a few weeks waiting for the Russians to let us into Berlin, as we were destined to handle the Press reports to U.K. from Berlin and to cover the Big Three Conference in Potsdam. We finally got into Berlin on 1 July 1945, after an altercation with the Russian guides who were supposed to take us into the city. At the meeting point there was a barrier across the road where a number of Russian officers seemed to be arguing and falling out amongst themselves. I, personally, saw one Russian club another with the butt of his revolver. Then we got the order 'Get moving' and the American tanks knocked down the barrier and we went into Berlin without the guides. On arrival all was flat so we moved into Zehlendorf in the outskirts, turned some Germans out of houses still standing and moved in. We handled all the press reports from the war correspondents, Reuters, Assoc. Press, etc. and later all the coverage of the Big Three Conference. The Desert Rats, 7th Armoured Div arrived in Berlin a week or so later, having been given the honour of being the first British troops into Berlin. I suppose they were the first 'official' unit to enter. After our job in Berlin was done, 30M was broken up and I was posted to 10M in Bad Oeyenhausen. 5 HQ Signals got a special commendation from General Eisenhower.

He began working full time at the apothecary shop where he had worked part time all through his high school years. However his plans and the plans of thousands of young men were changed on Dec 7, 1941 with the Japanese attach on Pearl Harbor. Lee volunteered for the U.S. Navy a few weeks later, but wasn't called to active service until February of 1942. He spent 12 weeks instead of the usual 16 weeks of boot camp at Great Lakes Naval Training Station near Chicago. Time for training was cut to the minimum in order to prepare these young men for overseas duty. Following boot camp, Lee was sent to Hospital Corps School and then picked for duty as Seaman 1st Class assigned to U.S. Naval Hospital, San Diego, then North Island Naval Base in San Diego. After further training there, he was one of 25 medics sent to a new troop ship, the USS Bladen and it was off to the South Pacific with the ship based at Guam. Before reaching Guam there was a stop in Hawaii and more training before being shipped out for destination unknown. This turned out to be Saipan, New Caledonia. From there the ship sailed to Hong Kong where 2300 - 2500 Chinese Nationalist troops and equipment were loaded aboard ship and transported to Tsingtao, China. Then it was back to Guam where American troops and equipment were loaded, again destination unknown, and this turned out to be Iwo Jima. These troops went ashore, Day 1, 3rd Wave of the bloody battle for Iwo Jima. After the troops went ashore the medics converted the ship to a hospital. It stayed about 500 - 1000 yards from shore during the day and casualties were brought aboard to be cared for. At night they moved out to sea for safety. The ship remained for 30 - 35 days caring for the injured brought aboard. Lee was there to see the flag raised on the hill of Iwo Jima. Soon after that historic event the USS Bladen returned to Guam with their cargo of injured fighting men. Lee's next assignment was aboard the USS Capricornus transporting troops to Okinawa. Here the troops also landed Day 1, 5th Wave. Again the ship was immediately converted to become a working hospital ship to receive the wounded and return to Guam. New Orders put the ship out to sea, destination unknown, and it was underway when the atomic bomb struck Hiroshima. They continued to Nagasaki and docked 19 days after the bomb struck there. In spite of his close contact with the radiation, Lee has been blessed to have had no ill effects, to his knowledge. The surrender was signed aboard the USS Missouri when he was at sea and the ship's orders were received to return home. The only leave from duty during the 47 months of service was a 9-day leave at the end of boot camp. He was formally discharged January 12, 1946. On January 26, 1946, Lee Phelps enrolled in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. Thanks to the G.I. Bill, he graduated January 26, 1950 and passed the tests to become a registered Pharmacist. He is married to Ruth Phelps, and they have four children: son, Craig and daughters, Jan, Mary and Kay.

After the quarantine was lifted, Don and his unit were assigned to Laharre, France. He crossed the Atlantic in a large troop ship and the voyage took 9 days.

After arrival at Laharre, his orders were changed and he was shipped to Erlanger, Germany in January 1946. That camp was just outside of Nierenberg.

Don worked at the Motor Pool and he was in charge of the shop. Two German mechanics worked with him but only one could speak English.
One of his buddies who was shipped over in January with him worked just across the runway and on the weekends, they borrowed a jeep and drove around Germany.

His love of music and humour started at an early age. He was at school with Ken Dodd and his mum, Ethel, mixed in theatrical circles and was a champion of the young Frankie Vaughan. Alan fell in love with jazz and big band music as a young man in the 1930's and soon acquired a collection of 78 rpm records. He became well known for carrying them around wherever he went! His favorites were the American big bands, the pop music of their day; Artie Shaw, Gene Krupa, Glen Miller, etc. This love stayed with him throughout his life. Little did he know, in his early teens that circumstances would present him with the opportunity to listen to them, live, much sooner than expected. When war was declared in 1939, Alan enlisted in the army and, because of his schooling as a draughtsman, after basic training was (at aged 18), he was posted for staff duties in London. He often talked about having a 'good war!' Strange but true. Based in the Union Jack Club! A civilian billet! His senior commanding officer was Colonel Fleetwood Hesketh of Southport fame. After security vetting (by no other than Anthony Blunt), Alan was assigned to Chief of Staff - Supreme Allied Command (COSSAC), later to become Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) and set to work as a draughtsman preparing battle maps for the Normandy landings and European invasion. He was also BIGOTTED (no not intolerant!). This was 'need to know' clearance to work on the deception plans to disguise the true invasion sites. Under General Eisenhower's command, SHAEF moved to Versailles and Alan followed there in 1944, prior to which he had been able to spend his free time in London listening to his favorite U.S. bands over here to entertain the troops. He was present at the Signing of the Surrender Document in 1945. He was then transferred to Dusseldorf and stayed in the army as Sergeant in charge of the German military government Intelligence Division Drawing Office until 1947. Alan met his wife, Dorothy, when she was working for the U.S. Army Air Force in Bushey Park. They were married in 1956 and have two children, Colin and Janet. Alan trained as an architect, working for local authorities, a job which brought him to Southport and the family home in Walmer Road. He was a magistrate there for 17 years. He became a Captain in The Territorial Army and was awarded the Territorial Decoration. He raised thousands of pounds for the Army Benevolent Fund through promotion of over 40 military band concerts in Southport. Alan was a founding member of what is now Southport Melodic Jazz Club. Initially he was Treasurer and later a Director of the club. When his health started to decline, he was appointed Honorary Lifetime President in April 2004. Branch of Service details: Royal Army.

His family relocated shortly thereafter to Chagrin Falls, Ohio where he grew up. Shortly after graduating from high school in 1942, Frank joined the U.S. Army Air Corps. Based on a good high school record, he was assigned to the Aviation Cadet Training Program at the University of Alabama, which he hoped would lead to joining his older brother as a pilot. However, problems with his eyes led to surgery and subsequent reassignment as a radio mechanic and transfer to Truax Field in Wisconsin. 
Frank was shipped overseas in 1944 to the China-Burma-India (CBI) theatre of operations and assigned to the 51st Fighter Control Squadron of the 10th Air Force. Staff Sergeant Ettinger served first in the Assam Valley of India and then in Burma, where he and his small detachment celebrated VJ Day in 1945. 
Frank returned to the States on New Year’s Day in 1946. Both he and his brother (the pilot) jumped at the opportunity offered by the new GI Bill, enrolling for the spring term at Bowling Green State University in their home state of Ohio. It was there that he met a pretty sorority girl who soon became his wife for the next 60 years. 
Frank stayed in the Reserves and was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. After several years of working in a variety of businesses, he discovered his passion as a 6th grade teacher.  Known as Mr. E, he taught math, science and history for 25 years in the Mayfield school district in Ohio. Frank now enjoys retired life, spending his time in Virginia and Florida. He loves participating in the Rocky Run Middle School’s annual World War II program and other veteran events.

He was a full time employee of White's Department Store in Covington from 1935 until December 1942 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army. Private Lassiter became a tank gunner (76 mm cannon) in the 612th Tank Destroyer Battalion at Fort Hood, Texas. He was soon promoted to Corporal. Only six months after enlistment he was selected for Officer Candidate School, and he was commissioned 2nd Lieutenant in August 1943. He came home for leave in 1944 just before his unit was to ship out for Europe. E.G. was accidentally injured when his brother exploded a firecracker under a tin can. The tin shrapnel cut an artery in his leg. After 15 days in the hospital, his leave was extended for healing. He returned to Texas after his unit had shipped out, so he was reassigned. A Colonel subsequently spotted E.G. giving a presentation to other service members, and had him transferred to the Intelligence Corps at Camp Ritchey, Maryland to learn military intelligence. E.G. returned to Texas and taught military intelligence at both Camp Roberts and Camp Tyler. Hundreds of Lieutenants and Captains, responsible for leading their units into World War II battles, were taught subject such as: battle tactics; coding/decoding messages; and avoiding enemy fire, including how to crawl under fire (He saw trainees killed when they stood up.). As months passed, forty-four of his OCS class members were sent to Europe and the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944. Reportedly forty-two of them perished during the war. Lieutenant Lassiter was then sent to Fort Ord, California with the 19th Training Regiment. He was awaiting orders to be sent to Japan. He worked for a Captain Revis for several months, who asked him to stay in Paso Robles as his assistant. As a soldier 28+ years old, with 2+ years of service and with a dependent, E.G. obtained 'Domestic Duty' status.

August 1944 Decision time: If a cadet had 2 years college he could waive the cadet program and go direct to a 4 month midshipman school and get a commission, or stay in the cadet program where the next school would again not include flying and more than a year to get wings if you survived the current 50% wash out rate.

At age 19 the thought of soon flying a fighter plane won out and he reported to Ottumwa, Iowa NAS mid March 1945. All the other officers in his unit were Academy men from the Pacific fleet, so he had to take ground school again with them and started to fly in early May. He got in a lot of flying, including passing both check rides in precision flying and landing, and also acrobatic flying that month. June, however, was substantially less flight time (Maybe V-E day figured into that). With little solid information as to when primary flight school could be completed and none about advanced flying, at Pensacola, he had realized that in late June of 1945 he had been on active duty nearly 2 years. Because Aviation was a special category he could ask for a transfer direct to the fleet if possible, and he did that. June 28, 1945 orders read to be released from flying at Naval Air Station Ottumwa and report to Deck Officers school Miami, Florida. July 10, 1945 he reported as required and during that training the war ended. After completing deck school in September 1945 he reported as directed to the PCS 1392, attached to the Sonar Training School in Key West, Florida. June 1946 he was released from the '92 to go to Great Lakes Training Center Illinois for release from active duty July 11, 1946. He got his honorable discharge from the inactive Naval Reserve on February 8, 1955. Lt(jg). ","","Wife Harriett E. Taylor and Sons Tom and Rex",""

I looked out the door and saw three Japanese planes coming down over an island right behind us. I notified our gun Captain, who notified the bridge that there were some Japanese planes coming in around behind us. We notified all the other ships and eventually shot them down. However, before they were shot down two of the planes came right at us. One flew directly overhead. This plane had so many holes in the gas tank that gasoline was leaking on our deck. The pilot dove to hit us but he missed and the bomb he had on board exploded right beside our ship, causing water to wash the deck and all the gasoline was washed away. General McArthur was one ship ahead of us in this convoy. A suicide bomber did hit his cruiser and several who were in the chow line were killed. We were in a convoy going to the main harbor into Manila, when one of the cargo ships sailed by us with a Japanese plane, sticking out of the side of the ship, above the water line. The Japanese plane, flown by a suicide pilot, had hit the ship. Our Captain talked to them and reported the Japanese pilot was still alive sitting in the cockpit. The pilot committed suicide with his pistol, even though they tried to talk him out of committing suicide. At Okinawa we were coming in with our convoy and a Japanese plane flew in right over the top of the water. The bullets were flying, they were everywhere, and we were even hit by bullets from other American ships. When the bullets finally ceased I was foolish enough to pull one of the 20 millimeter bullets out of the refueling hose that was stacked on the deck. Fortunately nothing bad happened. While at Okinawa we were firing at the Japanese airplanes and during a lull, my Gunnery Sergeant, who was in the turret with me, said, 'Look outside and see how many planes are out there'. I looked outside and said five. Those planes were just waiting on us. We finally ran out of ammunition. All of the planes were on fire. One plane went in between our stacks and cut a cable but didn't hit us. Another plane left a green streak from the paint of his wing that dragged across the deck. Another plane fired bullets that hit the bridge and killed six people. They were pretty effective when they were suicidal. ","","Staff of the Kansas Veterans Home",""

In November 1944, they were anchored at Manus Island close to the ammunition ship Mt. Hood when she blew up. Many were killed and wounded on both the Mt. Hood and nearby ships, but the Joy and her crew did not receive significant damage. Close to the end of the war, they were anchored in Okinawa and were ordered to sea to ride out a destructive typhoon. Several ships were sunk with loss of crew, but the luck of the Joy held and they came through with little damage. Warren received his discharge on April 17, 1946.

After his active duty discharge in 1946, Larry remained in the USMC Reserves in Jacksonville, Florida, until 1952. That is where, on a bowling excursion with his brother and friends, he met Frances. He would tell his brother upon seeing her bowling in an adjacent lane, 'that is the girl I am going to marry.' Larry did just that as he and Frances would spend the rest of their lives together. Larry and Frances would eventually make Miami their home and raise three children; Robert (Danny), Sandra (Sandy), and William (Billy). All of whom blessed Larry and Frances with many grandchildren. Larry passed away in 1997 and Frances in 2000 as they were reunited in eternity.

Then, he was transferred to St. Petersburg, FL for advanced basic training in Chemical warfare. While in St. Petersburg, he was billeted in the city's hotels. One hotel was the Vinoy. Three men occupied one room using the hotel's furniture from which they enjoyed an ocean view. The Vinoy was a far-cry from ordinary Army housing on a military base. As a squad leader, Sgt. Thomas recalls marching his troops from the hotels to training on a prepared field outside of St. Petersburg. The marching was on the streets, through town and in traffic. Oral commands were needed to guide his squad through the city's congestion. Sgt. Thomas remained in the States for his entire enlistment. His primary MOS, 870, was to train troops in the discipline of poison gas warfare. Beyond St. Petersburg he was stationed at Lincoln Army Airfield, Lincoln, NE; Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH; Kelly Field, San Antonio, TX; Tinker Field, Oklahoma City, OK and Victoria Airfield, Victoria, KS. On one occasion, while at the Lincoln Army Airfield, Sgt. Thomas arranged a training exercise that involved tear gas mixed with phosgene (smells like cut, green corn). When the gas canisters were activated, the troops were to break to the sides of their formation and move upwind from the gas. This time a trooper broke ranks and ran down wind with the expelled gas. He was seen to have outrun an unsuspecting rabbit that was caught in the maneuver. Sgt. Thomas recalls another training drill that involved familiarizing the troops with gas mask procedures. When the command, 'Gas!' was given, a soldier was to put on his mask and leave it in place until the, 'All clear!' was heard. The soldiers were not to remove their masks, however, until a prescribed series of steps were taken to insure that no gas was present in their area. The steps were: 1. Squat on heels in place. 2. With a finger pull part of the mask from face. 3. Take a quick sniff of gas to determine its type. 4. Clear the mask by exhaling. Even when the leader called, 'All clear!,' a soldier was to determine if gas was present in his area before removing the mask. The reasoning was that gas might be present in one area and not another, according to Sgt. Thomas. Sgt Thomas, now 88 years old, has not suffered any ill-affects due to proximity and handling of warfare gasses. He attributes his well-being to the thorough training he received from those who schooled him in chemical warfare. Sgt Thomas is Honored by his wife: Ila Marie Thomas; daughters: Sheryll Jean, Darlene Kaye and Joyce Ilene; Grandchildren: Dawna, James, Ryan, Lindsay, Emilie and Rachelle; and Neighbors: Lyle & Janice Brooks, David & Melva Sanner, Al & Jean Singleton, Jon Marks, and Kenneth & Susan Steinfort.

The family moved to Lake Wells, Florida, soon after and then when he was eight moved again to Belleville, Kansas. There he lived through high school years, graduating from Belleville High School in 1939. He attended Kansas State College in Manhattan, Kansas; graduating in May of 1943 with a degree in Journalism. After Pearl Harbor, a lot of young men were eager to 'do something for their country'. Jack Russell and his father, Russell, went to Kansas City where Jack Russell enlisted. His father also tried to enlist, but they told him 'you have had your war, Sir, go home'. Since Jack Russell had only three semesters at Kansas State College to complete his degree, the Navy deferred his going on active duty until after he graduated in May of 1943. Following graduation, he left on Memorial weekend for Notre Dame University for the Navy Officer Candidate School; earning his commission as an Ensign on September 22, 1943. He was one of the many known as a '90 day wonder' during the war, for earning their officer commissioning so quickly. After his commissioning, he was assigned to a new ship and sailed on her 'maiden' voyage down the Mississippi. This was a ship that was built near Chicago. They sailed to the Gulf of Mexico, around to the Atlantic and to Norfolk, Virginia. While in Virginia, he attended the USN Mine Warfare School in Yorktown, Virginia. He would later obtain the rank of LTJG. His war tours included working the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal Zone on a mine sweeper and working the ocean area between Japan and China on a mine sweeper. While in the Caribbean, his ship experienced a mine becoming entangled in their gear as they were ready to go into port. Jack Russell obtained a piece of that mine and carried it with him through the remainder of the war. Jack Russell was in Panama until the Japanese surrendered. Then he was sent to the Pacific and stationed in Japan. While there the ship he was assigned to did mine sweeping in the Sea of Japan. Because of his Journalism degree, he was the Communications Officer on each ship. It was while on the Sea of Japan that one day he contacted another minesweeper (because of their position on their RADAR). He told them to 'get out of there, you are in 'live' waters.' In seconds that ship was blown up. After this incident, the Japanese were ordered to sweep for the mines. His last assignment was in New Orleans, Louisiana. The various vessels and stations were as follows - USS Earle DMS-42; USS Elusive AM-225; USS YMS66, Mine Squadron Staff; USS CATBIRD, Mine Squadron Staff; and NSTA, Coco Solo, Canal Zone. Jack Russell earned the following medals - World War II Victory Medal, American Area Campaign Medal and the Asiatic-Pacific Area Campaign Medal with one Star. While on Terminal Leave, in April or May of 1948, Jack Russell sustained an injury to his neck during a swimming trip in Florida. He dislocated several neck vertebrates causing permanent paralysis. He was sent to the US Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida and spent a year there. Later he was flown to St. Albans Naval Hospital on Long Island, New York. From there he was honorably discharged with full disability benefits and moved back to Belleville, Kansas to his parents' home He remained there with nursing care for the remainder of his life; the next 20 years. He died in October of 1968. ","","Barbara Joyce Splichal",""

After flight school he began a series of duty stations first at Waco, Texas, where his assignment was as flight instructor for seven months. The next tour landed Roy at Sedalia Air Force Base in Missouri where he qualified in multi-engine ratings and eventually settled into flying C-47s, a troop/cargo transport. He greatly enjoyed troop/cargo because 'the places you flew to had good chow!' Along the way he received training in gliders at Vincennes, Indiana. This, it turned out was in preparation for night flying and towing gliders in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and then Pope Field, North Carolina. Roy shipped out from Fort Wayne, Indiana to California, then Seattle, then Honolulu. While stationed at Wheeler Field his primary assignment was to move troops and cargo throughout the Asiatic and South Pacific. He was training for the invasion of Japan when the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place. He was transferred back to Hawaii and then discharged on April 16, 1946. But before leaving Hawaii he participated in evacuating a group of stranded school children that was caught in a typhoon, this time piloting a B-25.

He got enough money from this trapping, as a teen, to buy a first class Italian accordion, which he had always wanted. As a young man during the great depression, Pete and a friend rode the rails through the West. They rode the trains in California north from San Bernardino. They lived on oranges and walnuts that had fallen in transport to the train depots. They got a job in Montana picking sugar beets. They finally got back to North Dakota, their starting point. He was in a Coventry, England, hospital after being wounded in the English Channel. His troop ship had hit a German mine in June 1944. Pete had a pretty good sense of humor. About his time hospitalized in Coventry, Pete would remark 'Never saw Lady Godiva!' Pete was in Cleveland at the Grile General Hospital until he was discharged in January 1945. A highlight for him was to see Bob Hope at the Cleveland train station walking to catch a train. Cleveland was Bob Hope's hometown. Pete played the accordion, a piano, or an organ once in a while after the war. He still had a bit of a hankering to play a musical instrument. This comes from his fond memories of playing in a small band around St. Paul, MN in the 1930s. Pete played the accordion, of course, and also would play bass fiddle and drums when needed. This was during the summer at a lounge on a Minnesota lake where the music would carry across to the other side. ","","Son Giles Richter",""

All of the Americans escaped unharmed except Ensign Robert G. Tills, 23 of Manitowoc WI, who was cut down by machine gun bullets. 'Ensign Robert Tills died in the fusillade of bullets from the Japanese strafers, the first American naval officer killed in the defense of the Philippines,' the Naval Historical Center wrote. Tills' sister Jean was 11 years old at the time. 'Our minister heard over the radio that he was among the missing and called us,' she said recently. 'Then somebody came to the house a couple of weeks later and said he was killed.' But Robert's body was not recovered. Memories were all that Jean and her parents and sister had of their beloved Bob. 'Airplanes and flying, that was his passion,' Jean Aplin, now 78 remembers. 'He wanted to do that from the time he was little. I was just very proud of him and idolized him. He was my hero.' Robert, whom the Navy named a destroyer escort after in 1943, was one of 78,000 Americans still missing from World War II. 'I always thought the Filipinos had probably found him and buried him somewhere over there,' Jean said. She had pretty much given up hope of ever learning what had become of her brother when the Navy notified her this past summer (2008) that his remains had been recovered from aircraft wreckage in Malalag Bay and identified through his dental records. 'Oh, I'm very happy about it,' she said, 'because I'm the only one left, and I've just always wondered, and I'm glad he's finally coming home.' But the story doesn't end there. 'We found the girl he was going to marry, his fiancee, and she is still alive and in good health,' Jean said. Jean, who lives in Colorado Springs, CO, found Vicki Quandt Lee through the Internet, living in Hendersonville, NC. 'She married somebody named Robert E. Lee, and she just couldn't call him Bob, so she always called him Lee,' Jean said. Now 89 and widowed, Vicki hopes to join Jean on March 23, 2009, when Bob Tills is finally laid to rest with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetary. ","","Sister, Jean Aplin",""

His boot camp training was at Fort Claiborne, Louisiana, and later he was transferred to Fort Dix in New York. In the spring of 1942 he and Chuck were sent to Europe to join the WW II fight against the hated Germans (Jerry's). Sometime after arriving in Europe, Dad and Chuck were split up and stationed in different battalions; Chuck, in the infantry and Dad in the artillery division. Dad eventually was promoted to the level of sergeant, heading up a crew of six that manned a huge cannon nicknamed 'Big Bertha'. During his 2nd year in Europe, it would seem ironic that Dad would meet his future bride through pen pal letters, and her mother's name would be Bertha. Barbara Jean Burns (mom) was a young nursing student in the spring of 1944, soon to graduate with an RN degree from the school of nursing at Norwalk General Hospital in Connecticut. As part of the nursing student's patriotic duty, they were asked to write to the GI's overseas, so as to bolster their morale during the long, dreadful war against the Germans. Dad had already been writing to a nursing student named Grace, when, for whatever reason, Grace gave Barbara his name. What started out as friendly letter writing, turned into a love affair that resulted in marriage, a union of 44 wonderful years which is carried on through 4 children, 7 grandchildren, and 5 great grandchildren. Mom kept the letters that Dad sent to her over the 2 years that they wrote to each other. Dad fell in love with a picture and words mom wrote on sweet smelling stationary.

Suddenly, a newscast broke in to say Japan had just bombed Pearl Harbor. Little did I, or anyone else at that moment, realize how that brief announcement would change all our lives. After graduation, I enrolled at the University of Kansas (KU) and managed a semester before my draft number came up. As I'd always wanted to fly, volunteering allowed me to choose the Army Air Corps. Boot camp was a radical change. There was a lot of sickness, earning the base the title of 'Pneumonia Gulch.' I was assigned to more training in Eau Claire, WI, then Santa Ana and Oxnard, CA. After 7-10 hours of training in a Stearman, I soloed---a big occasion! The bi-plane was sturdy and great for aerobatics, but its narrow landing gear made it susceptible to ground looping on landing. Primary flight training, 80-90 hours, concentrated on teaching us to recover from unusual/dangerous situations. At Merced, CA we flew the BT-13 Vultee, a single wing, larger and more powerful plane with an enclosed cockpit. It was called the 'Vultee Vibrator' as when in a spin it would vibrate and shake. One of the 'tricks' the instructors used on our first flight was to put the plane in a spin at about 7,000 feet, asking us to count the turns. Still talking (and about the time we reached 13 or 14) they said, 'don't ever allow this plane to spin more than 10 times as it wraps up so tight you can't recover.' That tested your fear and reaction time very quickly! With graduation, I went from Air Cadet to 2nd Lt., becoming co-pilot on a B-17. Our crew came together in Ardmore, OK, to begin flight training as a unit. If any dissent was noted, crew changes were made because it was important to work as a team, as each one's life may depend on the others. Being responsible for the lives of nine others at just 19 makes you grow up fast! Oddly enough, many pilots did not even have a driver's license. At Lincoln Air Force Base (Nebraska) we departed for overseas assignment. For security reasons, we were not permitted to open our orders until we were airborne.  Enroute to our assignment with the 301st Bomb Group, my bombardier and I were fortunate to accompany several Air Force colonels into Tunis. There, we encountered a young boy who was quite fluent in English. Although only 14, his education and experiences belied his young age. He said something then which didn't make sense, but has since; 'you Yankees think WWII is the great war, but that is yet to come. It is the war between my people, the Arabs, and the Jews.' How prophetic. On the very first mission, our airplane commander, Vic Drexelius was hit by flak, severing his right shin bone, and generating his return to the states. As co-pilot and after only six hours of night flying, I suddenly became the airplane commander, and was assigned a different co-pilot on almost every flight thereafter. I completed 35 sorties (or 53 missions as every flight of 8 hours or more counted as two). It was tough seeing planes go down; but probably less painful than having your best friend shot to pieces beside you in a foxhole. One mission our ground crew counted 105 holes in our aircraft from flak. Another mission seemed to start well, but suddenly there was an explosion in the #2 engine, white smoke started pouring out, it began to windmill and act as a brake. We started losing altitude and I told the bombardier to cut the wires and jettison the twelve 500-pound bombs over the Adriatic. I ordered all but myself, the co-pilot and flight engineer to bail out as the plane was still a potential bomb with a near-full fuel load. The vibration was so violent I decided to land at the 2nd Bomb Group base rather than going the extra 30 miles to ours. With fire trucks on the runway, the landing was without incident and I received the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for saving the $250,000.00 plane, and all crew bailouts were rescued. A friend with 34 sorties was so sure he would not return from the 35th and final one, that when he got up that morning he took his .45 and blew the big toe off his right foot to avoid flying that mission. After completing my missions, I went to see Capt. Fred Bell (Lawrence, KS), operations officer at Marcinese Airport in Rome, about flying VIPs in B-25s to get my Captaincy. Word came that the Bari mail plane had crashed with Lt. Bob Francis (another pilot from our squadron) and 23 nurses he was bringing to Rome for R&R. After hearing of the dog tags gathered from 26 burned bodies, those Captain bars weren't so important after all. I requested to return to the states, and on the fifth day aboard the return ship, V-E Day arrived. I declined B-29 training in favor of returning to school, and that fall I was again enrolled at the University of Kansas.","","Harlan Lill",""

Calvin was one of the first two 18-year-olds to be drafted in Ottawa County, Kansas. He was assigned to the 16th Armored Division at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Being among the top scorers, Calvin was selected to go to Aberdeen, Maryland, for additional training. Following this, he went to Camp Campbell, Kentucky. Training included Armored Basic Training, Artillery Mechanic Light and Anti-Tank Gun Crewman and a backup half track driver. As it ended up, he was the actual driver. Under General George S. Patton, his unit went to Europe. They were the spearhead which went to Pilzen, Czechoslovakia. Orders were to end the German occupation in Czechoslovakia. The assigned driver of the half track was afraid of being shot by the enemy through the open slot so he took cover and Calvin drove the half track. This suited him fine. Behind the half track he also pulled a 57-mm anti-tank gun. They met a group of Germans lined up along the way ready to surrender. When the Germans were told they had to surrender to the Russians instead of the Americans, the Germans picked up their weapons and said they would fight the Russians. One of these Germans, a Colonel, gave Calvin his pocket watch, watch fob and his German pistol together with the holster. While in Europe, the war ended with the Germans. When the call came out that 'anyone wanting to volunteer for Pacific Duty come sign up,' Calvin signed up. He did not want to go alone so he signed up some of his buddies who, at the time, were out playing. When they all got back to camp, the ones he had not signed up were upset because they wanted to go, too. They were unable to get their names on the list so had to stay behind and come later. When Calvin was almost to the U.S. shore, he learned that Japan had surrendered days after the Atom bomb was dropped. He was then sent to Fort Smith, Arkansas, for the remainder of his enlistment.

He was sent to North Carolina to work on dirigibles or blimps and his wife joined him as soon as possible to stay with him throughout the war. Rudy didn't talk about the service much until shortly before his death in 1995. He did, however, tell this story that year: 'I moved up north to Peoria, Illinois, from Paducah, Kentucky, after a flood in Paducah had wiped out my family's savings. My father was dead and I was responsible for taking take of my mother and sister back home. After several years, I was accepted into the apprenticeship program at Caterpillar Tractor Company, where I worked my entire life. When I enlisted, I had completed only one year as an apprentice machinist. One day in North Carolina, my superior officer called me in. The officer told me that they had a big Cat machine out in the yard that just wouldn't start. The officer knew that I had worked at Caterpillar and asked me to take a look at the machine. I was afraid to tell the officer that I really didn't have much experience on actual big Cats, so I agreed to take a look. I went out to the yard where the Cat was parked. I walked around the Cat, climbed into the cab, checked out the instrument panel, and then walked around the Cat another three or four times. Finally, I crawled under the Cat and regarded the undercarriage where I promptly fell asleep. After a very satisfying nap, I crawled back out and reported to my superior, with absolutely no idea of what was wrong with the Cat. 'Well?' asked the officer, 'what do you recommend?' 'Scrap it,' I said. And so they hooked the Cat up to an air carrier, flew out over the Atlantic and dumped it at sea. For all I knew, it could have just been out of gas!'

Carson Colorado. Upon completion of this training his company was sent to Ft. Dix NY for overseas travel to North Africa where his unit set up a major supply depot at Oran Algeria. Dad was in North Africa from March of 1943 to August of 1944 at which time his unit was shipped out for the invasion of southern France. Once in France his company set up supply depots throughout the French country side and traveling in a northward direction they went into Belgium right after the Battle of the Bulge and ended up in Antwerp, where he was when V - J Day came around.

Dad's battle field experience was that of a supply sergeant in the rear making sure that the vital and not so vital supplies used in the front lines made it to where they were going. One of my memories of Dad's stories was when his unit was traveling thru the Ardennes forest after the Battle of the Bulge. He noticed that the tops of some of the trees were cut and shaped in the form of a spear. This was done by the German troops to impale gliders and paratroopers.

After the war Dad returned to our home town of Longford, Kansas, where on March 28, 1948, he married my mom, Patricia C. Kail, also of Longford. He started his own bulk fuel delivery system; tried his hand at farming for a while; but then became the postmaster for the town, a job he stayed at for 20 years. When Dad retired he kept busy by mowing yards, cemeteries and for a while in the late 70's he mowed the Eisenhower Library Center's grounds.

Dad was one of the first group of men from Clay County to enlist in 1942 after Pearl Harbor and he didn't have too. Dad was pushing 40 years old when he enlisted, old enough to be excluded but he did it anyway.

At the time, he lived with his two sisters and parents in Santa Fe, New Mexico. At 17 years of age, he was a high school junior so his enlistment required his parents' written approval. He looked toward the National Guard as a means to earn a living. Errett's regiment, renamed the 200th Coastal Artillery (Antiaircraft), was activated and federalized into the U.S. Army on January 6, 1941. His assignment for the next year was to become a disciplined and proficient soldier. His regiment, however, was deployed to Fort Stotsenburg, Philippine Island, in September 1941. The 200th CA (AA) was the largest American military unit in the Philippines when the Japanese launched its air attack on Fort Stotsenburg and other locations in the Philippines about four hours after the Pearl Harbor attack. Errett did not have another peaceful day until he was liberated from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in September 1945. His first assignment was to make their way to Manila where a few antiaircraft guns were stored, still in their shipping crates. They hauled them back to Ft. Stotsenburg where they would set up to protect Clark Field. However, once uncrated, they found the guns slathered with thick coats of grease. They cleaned them up, assembled the guns, and were actively engaged in combat within a remarkably short period of time. With the men sick, nearly out of ammunition, cut off from resupply and subsisting on one-fifth rations, it was decided that the defenders of Bataan should surrender to the Japanese. Weapons and equipment were disabled and what little was left of the ammunition was blown up. The men were ordered to surrender on April 9, 1942. Errett walked the infamous Death March route for seven days. He was first held at Camp O'Donnell, PI, then Cabanatuan, PI, and then Bilibid Prison, PI, before being transported to Japan aboard the Nagato Maru, arriving at Tokyo Prison Camp #3, also known as Mitsushima. Errett toiled with others in constructing a hydroelectric dam. His specific job was to mix cement for the structure with his bare hands. After a year and a half at Mitsumisha, Errett was moved for the last time as a prisoner to Kanose near Niigata, Japan, where he and his fellow prisoners worked at the Showa Denko carbide plant. His joyful day of liberation was September 1, 1945. Errett was among the mere half of his 1,800+ regiment that returned from the war. Along the way, he witnessed many atrocities, inhumane treatment (some of which befell him), and pitifully few kindnesses. There was an old Japanese man and a boy, his grandson Errett thought, who lived near the Mitsushima camp that risked their lives to deliver a handful of live-saving provisions over the fence to his outstretched, grateful hands every now and then.

Being eligible at 21, I was sworn in. I was ordered to Des Moines, Iowa, for basic training, and then sent to Arkansas to attend Army Administration School. Shortly thereafter, I attended (NCO) Non-Commission Officers Training School. Upon completion of the course, I was appointed “Acting First Sergeant.” A few months later I became First Sergeant.  Also, during my time in Alabama I was appointed the first woman Sgt Major of Cadets at an Advanced Single Engine School. Then I volunteered to go overseas. From New York we sailed across the North Atlantic Ocean to England where I was assigned as secretary to the Base Commander of Service and Supply. During the D-Day operations, many other WACS and I worked in SHAEF, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. While the “Battle of the Bulge” raged on and no planes could aid the troops there due to the heavy fog, I returned to London to await assignment in France. The fog lifted in December and we flew to Paris. From there seven WACS and I commandeered taxis to General Eisenhower’s headquarters in Versailles. I was assigned as secretary to Brigadier General Robert A. McClure, who was Chief of Psychological Warfare Division with offices on Champs Elysees where I worked until the end of the war on May 8, 1945.  After celebrations with thousands of G.I.s and French people, I believed I would be going home to America. Instead, our organization’s name was changed to “Information Control Division (ICD).” We moved to Germany to take over all the radio stations and newspapers in Germany. We set up offices in Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and Norway, One of our jobs was to publish thousands of brochures showing the horrors of the concentration camps operated by the Germans, and photos of their scrawny captives. These brochures were dropped from planes for the German populace to see. In October 1945, I received orders to return home and be discharged.  With  10,000 other soldiers, we sailed on the Queen Mary.  We received a great welcome in New York. ['Veteran's Voices' interview by Bill Thomas, September 9, 2011, Sun Newspapers.

He was in the gun turret of his ship when a kamikaze flying low over the water headed straight for the side of the ship below the turret. At first, the 9 men in the turret were trapped. Finally able to escape, they waded through water up to their knees, put on life jackets, and jumped off the ship. 'Our ship went down. In 7 minutes, it was completely gone.' Their delay in getting out of the turret contributed to their survival. The ship, struck near the rear, filled with water in the aft portion and lifted vertical with the bow in the air before sinking straight down. As the ship sunk, water pressure set off the ammunition; the resulting concussion in the water sent a shock wave that injured many of the seamen who had made quicker escapes from the sinking ship and were further out in the water. Sharks, drawn by the blood of the injured seamen, attacked them, leaving the uninjured alone. Sharks weren't the only thing the survivors had to worry about, 'Those Japs still strafed us. They flew over us and fired---boop, boop, boop.' The destroyers and both LSMRs were sunk that day. 'If it wouldn't have been for the LCIs, we wouldn't have survived. There were a lot of survivors out there to be picked up.' In the water an hour and a half before being plucked out, he bobbed in a pool of spilled diesel fuel. The two LCIs, the smallest ships in the group, spent the entire day picking survivors out of the water before heading back to Okinawa at nightfall. 'There were so many survivors we all had to stand up. Only the wounded ones got to sit down on a bed.' He still has the prayer book he carried like a talisman throughout his time in the Navy. He had no explanation for how the book, in his pocket that day while he floated in the ocean, survived unscathed. The staples are a tinge rusted, but otherwise the book remains readable 60 years after his ordeal. The Battle of Okinawa, destined to be the final battle of WWII, spanned 82 days. The naval fleet at Okinawa was the largest armada ever assembled by the US (his ship was part of the front line). 'April 1, 1945, that's when we attacked Okinawa. We lined up side by side, the 12 ships, and we moved into the beach. When we got close enough, they fired all those rockets---the ships. I don't know how many ships were behind us.' An important part of Japanese strategy during the battle for Okinawa was attack by the suicide pilot force known as the 'Divine Wind'---the kamikaze. Dan, drafted at age 20 and inducted in Kansas City on June 2, 1944, didn't get any choice about serving in the military. He did get a say in which branch. 'I had a choice, so I took the Navy.' After boot camp and training, Dan was sent to New York City to learn to be a gunner and spent time in Virginia Beach, VA., before being sent to Charleston, SC, where he was assigned to LSMR-194. It was a medium-sized amphibious ship designed to fire rockets from the sea. On Dec. 4, 1944, they sailed out of Charleston, headed for the Panama Canal. A week later, passing through the canal, they headed for San Diego, arriving Christmas Eve of 1944. They then sailed to Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Okinawa in late March. A few days after his rescue, he was taken to San Francisco, received a month's leave and went home to visit family. Finishing his duty in CA, he was discharged in June 1946, and returned to his family's farm. He married Alexia Schmidt on Oct. 20, 1947. They moved to Hays, Kansas, in 1955 and had three daughters and a son. She died on Oct. 25, 1992. He retired from ranching and maintenance work in 1986 and worked at a grocery store until 1998. He married Ann Sanders Kreutzer on May 28, 1999. Now 85, he still clearly remembers the cold of the water and the smell of the diesel fuel on that day off the shore of Okinawa. 'There were 65 suicide planes,' Sander said. 'We didn't have a chance'","","Family of Dan Sanders",""

He went to basic training at Ft. Hood, TX. On his way to fighting in the war, his troop carrier stopped in Hawaii for a two-week training on how to survive in the jungles. He was sent to Saipan where 25,000 Japanese civilians and soldiers committed suicide by jumping off Banzai Cliff as ordered by the Japanese Emperor.

On Okinawa, the company commander from C Company came back and selected about 70 replacements to fill the slots for those that had been killed or wounded from the previous weeks. Carl was selected to be a machine gunner. Carl told his commander, 'I don't want to be a machine gunner.' The commander asked why not and Karl replied, 'Machine gunners don't last very long; the Japanese will do anything to get rid of a machine gunner.' His commander told him, 'If you live the first three days, you will have made it.' There was a tent where a priest was available to give the last rites before soldiers began fighting. Out of the five, Carl was the only one to survive.

After Okinawa, Carl was sent to Cebu, Philippines in preparation for the Japanese invasion of Tokyo. Following the dropping of the atomic bombs, he then went to Hokkaido to aid in the US occupation, then down to Tokyo. When the war was over, he drove a truck and hauled supplies to military camps and saw some beautiful parts of Japan. In Nov. 1946, Carl sailed to San Francisco Bay and received his honorable discharge from the army at Camp Beale. Carl returned to Montezuma, KS and married Vera Mae Steward. Together, they farmed for about 30 years. Retired from farming, they moved to Dodge City, KS where they lived for 25 years.

I drove tanks and armored cars in combat and reconnaissance missions. The strangest sight was driving an M-4 tank through Munich and not seeing a single house standing! Once I rode 7 days and 6 nights in a box car with 39 other soldiers. The guys would go to sleep and kick. I have scars yet today to prove it. The Germans would bomb the railroad causing us to go back from the front. I did not live in fear because we were trained to kill or be killed. When I went to town, I carried a pistol. The people of Germany didn't associate much with us. The little kids were friendly because we gave them candy and gum. Accommodations varied in Germany - tents, hotels, German barracks, beer hall. Once I stayed in a house while guarding a pile of German bombs. We went to Mass every Sunday ministered by Army chaplains and once went to midnight Mass in a German church. In our free time, we washed our pants and shirts in gasoline when we had no soap. When we had no meat in our K-rations, we would buy a cow with cigarettes or shoot a deer. Trips to other countries were offered on seniority basis and to a limited number of soldiers. I celebrated my 22nd birthday on the ship back to America in July, 1946. The Statue of Liberty looked a lot nicer coming home than it did when I left, not knowing if I would see it again. About 2 weeks after landing in New York, I got home to Missouri. I was discharged in August, 1946 from Fort Sheridan, near Chicago, Illinois. After the welcome home wore off, life was dull. There weren't any jobs and the ones available had been taken by earlier returning Veterans. I went 9 months before I found a job. After several jobs, my wife and I successfully ran a Western Auto Store in Augusta, Illinois for 49 years retiring in 2001. My wife, Hilda, of 58 years and I have raised eight children, 18 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. I resented Germany because they started a war over power, which caused hardship and expense, loss of loved ones. They took two years of my life for the Army. But, I was proud to serve our country to have freedom for everyone. Hopefully, the little bit I did helped in some way. Awards earned: Belgian, France Cord., 9th Infantry Division. Good conduct, 1 Battle Star, Occupation Ribbon, and ETO Ribbon. My ranks were Level - T-5; Private, Corporal, & Platoon Sergeant. ","","Theresa Brierton",""

With that program in place the Navy had a limited number of combat pilots on December 7, 1941. A few days after the Japanese struck Hawaii, the Navy asked Rear Admiral Thomas Hamilton to develop an intensive program that would include physical, academic and spiritual training for high school graduates. That program would allow 18 year olds to enter Navy Pilot training program if they could pass the entrance exam and meet the physical requirements the Navy demanded. With that program in place, a local airport owner/pilot instructor started recruiting men just as Karl Marrs completed his solo flight check. By early September, 1942, he had a class of 17 ready to go to Kansas City. The five hour academic test went well for all 17 but the following day two were eliminated during the physical exam. At age 18, nine months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Karl R. Marrs had joined the Navy V-5 Flight Program with 15 of his home town high school classmates. Nine months after they started at the University of Iowa, he was one of three from the original hometown group to graduate at the Pensacola Naval Air Station and wear the Wings of Gold of a Naval Aviator. He soloed a PBY-5B at age 19 and flew that seaplane for several months before making the transition to the PB4Y-1 as a Co-Pilot/Navigator at NAS Chincoteague VA. After completing that training his crew flew a new PB4Y-1 (B24-J) to North Africa, via the southern ATC route and joined VPB-112, a squadron in Fleet Air Wing-15. His crew flew several Anti-Sub and convoy cover missions in the Gibraltar Funnel area before being transferred to England in early January of 1945, where they joined Fleet Air Wing-7. After completing 27 combat missions, in that area, they returned to the States for reorganization for duty in Alaska with the new PB4Y-2. Before that training was completed the hostilities with Japan had ended and he was released from active duty after a short stint in the South Pacific. The flying career for Karl was put on hold for fifteen years. After fifty years of livestock and grain farming in southern Kansas, Karl wrote a book, 'I WAS THERE WHEN THE WORLD STOOD STILL'. It was about his 'War Years' and just for his family. He wanted them to know that he was not a hero and did nothing but serve his country just as thousands of other young men and women had done during that period of history. Fifty-five years after WWII ended and just before the book went to press the Navy decided to award each flight crew member of Fleet Air Wing-7 the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medals for every five missions they had completed. That put a shade of grey on his attempt to downplay the hero bit for his family. ","","Eisenhower Foundation",""

On March 24, 1944 he was shipped to Pear Harbor's AIEA Receiving Barracks. On May 8th 1944, Paul was assigned to the ship USS Livingston AKA 163 and then participated in a task force for the invasion of Saipan, Mariana Islands. On June 11th, they landed troops in Saipan and for four days were under constant attack from Japanese planes and shore batteries. That was Paul's first combat experience. Following the Saipan operation, the USS Livingston went to Apamama in the Gilbert Islands, picked up the 7th AAF and took them to Saipan. After they unloaded the troops, the ship moved over to Tinian Island, picked up Japanese prisoners, then picked up additional prisoners at Saipan and moved them all back to Pearl Harbor for confinement. The prisoners numbered 250 and 76 of them were wounded. Six of the prisoners died enroute and were buried at sea. On the return to Pearl Harbor he was reassigned to a new ship, the USS Caviler APA 37. On that ship, he participated in the invasions of Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, Luzon and Zambales Beach, Luzon. While on that ship, the task force was attacked by Japanese suicide planes. A ship just off the port bow of Paul's ship was hit broadside and exploded. They met no enemy fire at Zambales Beach, Luzon. However after they left the area as the last ship on the column on January 30, 1945, they were hit by a torpedo at 1:30 in the morning in #5 hole. One torpedo went behind the ship and the second one hit them. They were able to stay afloat but had to be pulled back by tugs from the fleet to Leyte. Paul was returned to Pearl Harbor where he was assigned to another ship, the USS Barnwell APA 132. On August 15, 1945, the Japanese surrendered, while the Barnwell was docked at Manus in the Admiralty Islands. The ship had a wonderful celebration - the men shot flares and guns into the sky. The war over; a feeling of relief was evident. After the Japanese surrendered, the ship was used to transport troops to Japan for occupational duties. They also made trips to Kure and Sasebo.

Bud enlisted in the Army at Ft. Leavenworth in December, 1941, and spent nine months training at engineering school at Shepherd Field, Wichita Falls, Texas. Bud was assigned to an aircrew out of McCook, Nebraska and ended up on a B-24 four-engine heavy bomber, the 'Bama Baby. The 'Bama Baby flew missions out of Tunis, North Africa, and Carinola, Italy, in early 1944. They also participated in the runs against the Ploesti Oil Fields in Romania. At the time, an aircrew member could be sent home after 50 missions, and crewmen often volunteered for extra missions to build up points. Bud and a buddy flew with another crew on a mission to bomb a ball-bearing plant in Hungary on April 21, 1944. Bud was severely wounded in the leg when the plane was shot down over Yugoslavia; it was his 21st mission. His buddy from the 'Bama Baby crew, Art Linz, was killed. Bud parachuted out over the mountains, landing in a herd of sheep. 'I landed in the German side of the mountains. On the other side were Yugoslavian freedom fighters and I would have been safe.' Bud was captured by the Germans and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner, first in a German hospital and then in a series of P.O.W. camps. In the spring of '45 he and fellow prisoners were transferred to Nuremberg and then to Munich, as the Germans were being squeezed between the advancing Russians from the east and the Americans from the west. They were liberated in by Patton's army in the spring of 1945. Bud got to talk to Patton, whom he describes as 'a tough old guy.' Bud was then moved by troop train to Camp Lucky Strike in LeHavre, France, where he was part of a group visited by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. 'He came down the line and shook my hand; he said the war was over in Europe,' Bud remembers. After being shipped home, Bud had shrapnel removed, including a rivet from the B-24, which had been embedded in his leg the entire year and 12 days he was a P.O.W.

He began working as an assistant attorney for the rationing coordination section, in particular, with rubber and tire rationing for the war effort.
Then, in Aug 1942, Richard was accepted to the Officer Training Program at the Naval Air Station, Quonset Point, Rhode Island. He was transferred to Ottumwa, Iowa in Oct 1942, where he served as Aide to the Executive Officer. Richard frequently requested a combat assignment and finally succeeded with an overseas post in May 1943. After a brief leave to Whittier, he reported to San Francisco and sailed to New Caledonia on May 31, 1943, where he worked as a staff officer, primarily in logistics, in the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT). Pat Nixon remained in San Francisco, working for the OPA while he was out at sea, as she reasoned that was where he would return. Richard was promoted to Lieutenant on October 1, 1943.
In January 1944, his unit was moved to the Solomon Islands, a frequent target of Japanese air raids, and in February, he supported the U.S. attack on Green Island in a logistics role. He received a Letter of Commendation for his 'meritorious and efficient performance' at both. During this time, he developed his interest for poker and in his memoirs he referred to a poker game in which he drew a royal flush. It is believed that his substantial winnings were used to help finance his first congressional campaign. Richard's combat tour ended in July 1944 and he and Pat returned to San Francisco where he was assigned to Fleet Air Wing 8, Alameda, working on transportation problems. Transferred to the East Coast in November 1944, the Navy made use of his legal training by assigning him the task of terminating defense contracts. Praised for his 'meritorious service, tireless effort, and devotion to duty' he was credited with saving the Navy millions of dollars.
In August 1945, President Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon were in the famous Times Square crowd celebrating the Japanese surrender. President Nixon was released from active duty in September 1945, but agreed to stay until December 31, 1945, to clear up a few contract terminations. In October 1945, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
He was awarded the American Campaign Medal, The Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.

When completed, my group was shipped out to Oahu, Hawaii on a converted pineapple cargo ship. I was stationed at a camp near the entrance of Pearl Harbor from May 1944 to August 1944. I had radio duty while awaiting assignment in the Asiatic Theater. While there I met my cousin, Lewis McKee, my Abilene classmate and close friend, as he was awaiting assignment with the Fleet. I was assigned with 8 other radiomen to a Seabee outfit called Gropac 10. We were in the Palau Islands occupied with the Japanese. The U. S. needed Palau for a Navy airbase and Anguar 5 miles south, for an Army B-24 airstrip. Both were seized after heavy fighting and were secured. Gropac 10 landed D-5 after the Fleet had partially secured three beaches and destroyed the major town there. The duty of the Seabees of Gropac 10 was to restore ways to land equipment and supplies to build the airstrip, and provide proper facilities for the American occupation. My unit of radiomen worked on 3 different beaches of the Island and we served as the source of communication between the supply ships, landing craft and the shores of Angaur. The whole series of Islands that make up the Palaus covered over 100 miles in length and the Navy surrounded them with many ships and landing crafts that we kept in contact via voice messages. At the northern end of the Palau Island was a large reef area that was named Kossol Roads. It was used as a staging area for the U.S. Fleet. They could sail this far east without escort. We were 300 miles east of the Philippines and still occupied by the Japanese. While I was there, I was assigned to a decommissioned LST that served as the Port Director for this staging area. It was known at that time as the only non-land Port Director in the world. After that duty, I returned to Anguar and rejoined my unit that was the command communication source for the island.

Virgil, a veteran of World War I, supported his growing brood as a rural mail carrier and truck farmer. During the years of the Great Depression, Esther worked in a local mattress factory to help make ends meet. Quentin attended McKinley, Sand Springs, and Lincoln elementary schools, later graduating from Abilene High School. In May 1945, Quentin was a seventeen-year-old high school senior who, like so many of his classmates, enlisted in military service out of a sense of patriotic duty. Three older brothers were already serving. Olney, was a Navy Air Force pilot in the Pacific; Lewis was a ship's gunner in the Pacific; and Kay was a cadet in the Army Air Force in Waco, Texas. The youngest brother, Virgil, Jr., would later serve in the Korean War. Two young daughters, Val Jean and Patricia, completed the McKee family. Quentin went through basic training at the Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois. He recalls training exercises to extinguish shipboard fires and target practice along the waterfront of Lake Michigan. An ever-present danger was that the 20- and 40-milimeter guns might blow-up on the 4-5 sailors who manned them. At the conclusion of boot camp, Quentin's unit boarded a train, certain that they were destined for San Diego. Instead, they were transported to the Naval Ammunition Depot at Hastings, Nebraska. Hastings was a college town, and sailors were a welcomed addition at campus social events. In addition, USO-sponsored dances were held every Saturday night. In his spare time, Quentin honed the popular art of sketching pin-up girls. His fellow sailors admired his work and soon were commissioning works to hang in their offices and on their bulletin boards. From Hastings, it was relatively quick train trip back home to Abilene. While stationed at the NAD, Quentin worked in the personnel office, keeping track of liberty leave, sick leave, weekend passes, and sailors who were AWOL. His last six months of service were in the records office. For his military service, Quentin received the World War II Victory Medal. Following his discharge, with the rank of Seaman 1st Class, Quentin enrolled at Kansas State University. Within the year, he left to study at the Kansas City Art Institute for two years. In 1949, he returned to Abilene to join the family business, McKee Gardens, for the next twenty years. In 1952, Quentin married Mary Ellen Farr. Seven children were born over the next 13 years: Kim, Robin, Christie, Jill, Weston, Miles, and Molly. Quentin continued to pursue his passion for art through night classes offered by Kansas State University. His paintings were selected for a number of art showings, including those on campus. Today, Quentin lives in Salina, Kansas, and, at nearly 78 years of age, continues to work fulltime at his own landscaping business. When he isn't working, he does his best to keep up with eighteen grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.","","Kim E. (McKee) Barbieri",""

Gen. McSherry graduated from high school in Grand Junction, Colorado, attended Colorado College, and graduated from University of Arizona with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1916 and a B.S. in Mining and Metallurgical Engineering in 1917. He studied French and Political Science at the University of Paris and post graduate work in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Brig. Gen. McSherry was a career soldier who enjoyed a successful career with varied assignments and military schools prior to WWII. When the war began, he was stationed in Washington, D.C. with the War Department and was involved with the Federal Security Agency, National Defense Advisory Committee and the War Manpower Commission. It was during this period that he developed a War Department program for training civilian mechanics for war industries. At Brig. Gen. McSherry's instigation, President Roosevelt appointed an Inter-departmental Board in March 1939 to deal with the inter-departmental jealousies and a lack of coordinated policies for vocational training. It is interesting to note that the program he developed was later adopted and used during the war. In Sep 1939, he was appointed liaison officer with the Federal Security Agency, in addition to his other duties. He was a major player in developing the Training Within Industry Program, the National Defense Vocational Training Programs in all states, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska, changed the type of training given in N.Y.A. projects and expanded training in the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1942, over ten million workers attended or secured training through one or another of the programs under his general supervision. After arriving in North Africa, he was put in charge of writing policies, directives and instructions for the Allied Military Government for Sicily. He and his personnel entered Sicily with the combat troops in the initial landing and immediately established postal, educational, and railroad systems, agriculture, shipping, banking, labor, courts, and other governmental departments, sometimes while the fighting was still going on. Later, jurisdiction was extended to southern Italy and Naples. He also wrote proposed directives of the combined Chiefs of Staff for six liberated countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway) and two occupied countries (Germany and Austria). Brig. Gen. McSherry and his staff were also responsible for the following: freezing the resources of banks; collecting foreign gold stock which the Nazis had hidden, impounding all German Foreign assets and all foreign currency, re-establishing courts, trade unions, social security systems, initiating food and emergency housing programs, re-establishing police systems, and brought order out of general chaos. On 5 December 1943, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law from Palermo University, and in 1945, the Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Arizona. Brig. Gen. McSherry retired from Active Service in December 1946 after more than 39 years of exemplary service to his country. His military education included: the Battery Officers Course, the Advanced Gunnery Course, the Command and General Staff School and the Army War College. His decorations include: Distinguished Service Medal as Deputy Assistant Chief, SHAEF G-5 Div.; Legion of Merit; Bronze Star; War Department General Staff Insignia; Croce al Valore Militare (Italian); Commander, Order of British Empire; Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur (French); Croix de Guerre with Palm Leaf (French); Knight Commander, Orde Van Oranje-Nassau (Netherlands); Commander de l'Ordre Grand Ducal de la Courenne de Chane (Luxembourg); Commander, Order of Leopold II (Belgian); and the Carbineri Medal (Italian).

He graduated from Hinckley High School May 1944 and, upon receipt of the famous 'Greetings' letter from President Roosevelt, he was drafted and inducted into the Army at Ft. Snelling, MN and further processed at Jefferson Barracks, MO in Jan 1945 and sent for armored basic training at Ft. Knox, KY. Following a brief delay-en-route (not a furlough) after basic he went by troop train (the old coal fired steam type) to Fort Ord, CA replacement depot for processing for overseas duty. He departed by troop ship from California on 7 July 1945 for a destination unannounced until at sea and after zigzagging, for security reasons, across the Pacific with a stopover in Hawaii he landed at Manila in the Philippines and then transferred to Cabanatuan, Luzon for service with the 43rd Infantry Division - Field Artillery Battalion. On 6 and 9 August 1945 President Truman ordered the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (President Roosevelt had died on 12 April 1945) and on 14 August 1945 (his 19th birthday!) it was announced that Japan had surrendered. By troop ship he was sent to Yokohama, Japan for Army of Occupation duty with the 1st Cavalry Division. On Sep 30, 1945 he received Orders from General MacArthur that read in part and in typical military shorthand: 'Following named enlisted member, now on temporary duty Advance Echelon, GHQ AFPAC, APO 500, WP Hiroshima and Nagasaki and such other places adjacent thereto as may be necessary for carrying out instructions. Upon completion of this duty, member will return Advance Ech. GHQ AFPAC, APO 500. EM auth travel between Hiroshima and Nagasaki at such times as may be necessary in the accomplishment of their mission. Member will report to Col. A.W. Oughterson for duty. Travel by military aircraft is directed for accomplishment of an emergency war mission . . . .' This order was for service with the ATOMIC BOMB COMMISSION which was composed of several American medical doctors and two or three enlisted men and a contingent of Japanese doctors and nurses and two male Japanese cooks both of whom had been combat soldiers. One of the cooks lost his wife and one child as a result of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The commission ate, slept and worked on site and the area was 'off limits' to area occupation troops because of radiation concerns. After the bombs were dropped early reports in the field in the Philippines indicated that 'vegetation would not grow for a hundred years' but that early report was far from reality. 'I was the only Minnesotan who served with the Atomic Bomb Commission and so at my demise that page of history will have been turned. Upon completion of the Atomic Bomb Commission assignment I served with the USA Typhus Commission in Tokyo. The task of the typhus commission was to spray Japanese civilians with DDT powder because at war's end lice were a health problem among the Japanese populace. The goal was to protect the Occupation troops from Typhus by spraying the civilian population. The Japanese welcomed the opportunity to be sprayed with the DDT powder and they lined up in long lines to await the spray treatment. Upon completion of USA Typhus Commission service my final service was in Tokyo at General MacArthur's headquarters in the Dai Ichi building. We would see General MacArthur every day. He was so disciplined that you could 'set your watch' by his departure time. The Japanese citizens had great respect for General MacArthur and in anticipation of his daily departure from the building they could be seen stopped on the sidewalk waiting for him to exit the building and to enter his chauffeured vehicle. I was returned stateside and received my Honorable Discharge after two years and eleven days with one year, four months, and two days foreign service.

You have served in the greatest Navy in the world. It crushed two enemy fleets at once, receiving their surrenders only four months apart. It brought our land-based airpower within bombing range of the enemy, and set our ground armies on the beachheads of final victory. It performed the multitude of tasks necessary to support these military operations. No other Navy at any time has done so much. For your part in these achievements you deserve to be proud as long as you live. The Nation which you served at a time of crisis will remember you with gratitude. The best wishes of the Navy go with you into civilian life. Good luck. Sincerely yours, James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy.

I realize that any expression of mine will be wholly inadequate to assuage your grief and anxiety, yet I want you to know that you and the other members of his family have my thoughts at such time.

Aircraft carriers, cargo ships, cruisers, battle wagons, sea plane tenders, destroyers, hospital ships - all lay penned in this pseudo - secure haven surrounded by low, sturdy mountains that sneak down to dip their humid toes in the nervous Pacific Ocean. I am scared - I pray. I stand guard again this morning, my white T-shirt soaked with sweat, the sweat of fear mixed with the sweat of the hot, sultry day that is about to present itself. Each second closer to daylight brings the bile from my churning stomach nearer to my tightening throat. My heart begins a rapid thump - a thumping not unlike the thumping tom-toms my ancestors savagely beat in a pre-battle frenzy. I am scared - I pray. I have been rehearsed, drilled, lectured to and whipped through our assigned paces more times than I want to remember. I know my part and I have remembered my lines for haven't I played this scene and role time and time again in the past two and a half years - a little more than one tenth of my life? I know what to expect, I know what to do - but still - I am scared - I pray. I stand here in my own puddle of sweat, my hand on the gun and I pray! - but God is preoccupied for just as the orange ball of sunrise pops over the Okinawa Mountains - screaming, single-minded, sacrificial Kamikaze planes accompany it. Each indiscriminately scavenging for any luckless U.S. frigate - any war wearied, battle scarred ship that can be targeted to be the crypt for their flying caskets. I am scared - I pray. Donald R.

You seem to be worried a little about church. Well, while we're out in boot camp, everyone has to go�Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. We have a 9:30 Mass in a big auditorium with about 2,000 kids there. They have temporary kneelers there and prayer books. I think I'll go to confession tonight if I can find where the Catholic chaplain is. About that quartermaster business�it is supposed to be the most respected position, besides the officers of the ship. A quartermaster is the assistant to the officer of the deck, stands on the bridge with all the gold braid, plots courses, must know how to navigate, read the stars, know different signals, read compasses, and is in general an all around man. When you tell the boys around here that you have been recommended (I want all of you to keep that in mind�I haven't been selected yet, only recommended, and I won't know for sure for about 3 weeks.)

'Out of the dark silent night, above the murmur and moans of the patients in our hospital tents, the drone of the enemy planes are suddenly and distinctly heard overhead. Everyone makes a dash outside, some to fox holes, others merely standing still and looking upward. Out of the dark silent night, flares begin to fall and hundreds of anti-aircraft guns begin to bark. Lower and lower the flares drop becoming brighter as they gradually descend to earth. Everyone breathes a silent prayer that the flares will grow dim or be shot out before dropping to earth to show the enemy the hidden troops or installations. Slowly one by one the flares grow dim. Others are shot out and the droning planes overhead recede in the distance only to return some other night. We all breathe a sigh of relief.

Trained as a four engine B-17 pilot, I was sent to the 15th Air Force and stationed at Foggia, Italy, from where 35 missions were flown over Europe in the following countries: Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Poland. The Battle of the Bulge occurred during this period and we were wondering who would prevail. Luckily, it was the Allies. My most exciting mission occurred on my 10th mission to Vienna, Austria, where we were to go over at 30,000 feet. At 29,500 feet, a cylinder head blew out on number 2 engine and while trying to feather the prop, number 1 engine blew a cylinder head. Turning around the heading back we jettisoned our bombs, added full power on the 2 remaining engines and crossed the snow packed Alps at 15,000 feet. Gradually, altitude was being lost in order to maintain flying speed. We were now down to 7,500 feet and just above the overcast, with mountains protruding above the clouds. Number 3 engine blew a cylinder head and altitude decreased, putting us in the clouds with the mountains. I gave the order to bail out. All 11 men landed safely. I was close to being shot until the Yugoslavs found out I was an American. We spent 10 days getting out of Yugoslavia. We walked, took a bob sled, rail car, truck, river boat and finally a DC 3 airplane. When returned to Italy, we found we had been reported missing in action. The plane that we were flying was an F model, all the rest were G models. Upon returning to the base, the crew chief told me he was not surprised at losing the engines as all had over 500 combat hours, but he was not allowed to replace one until shot out or mechanical failure occurred. Other experiences included coming home on 3 engines six times, landing with an engine on fire. On the longest mission, I came home alone on three engines, a bomb exploded about 500 feet below our plane, had all our gas tanks shot up, landed with a load of bombs and the brakes shot out. Landed with a flat tire, my left wingman was hit by 105 mm flak, destroying the plane and killing all. A hole was shot in the astrodome just after the navigator was looking out of it. A plane in front of us crashed and blew up during takeoff. The nose of our plane was nearly torn off by another plane that landed and over shot the runway. On another mission, flak badly damaged our instrument panel. For my services, I was awarded the WW 2 Victory Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, the African European Campaign Medal, four Air Medals and the Distinguished Flying Cross. This period of life all occurred before my 21st birthday. ","","Wife, Norma Arlene; children, Ryamond Lynn and Karen Lea",""

He served with the 657th Field Artillery; TSFET Motor Pool. He went through basic training and duty at Fort Tilden, NY with the Coast Artillery. In Jan 1944, he was stationed at Camp Rucker, AL in the Field Artillery, B Battery. In Nov 1944, he was sent to Fort Sill, OK and in Jan 1945, to Camp Chaffee, AR. He then went to Camp Kilmer, NJ before heading to Europe on Feb 4th or 5th, 1945. David stayed in Cheltenham, England for a week and then on to Dieppe, France to get 8' guns and other equipment. He set up guns near Pontivy, France to point at Lorient. He dug a fox hole and manned his armor piercing, water cooled, .50 caliber. Belt fed, machine gun from that fox hole. On May 8, 1945, as one of the trucks returning from taking showers passed David's fox hole, the GIs yelled, 'The war is over!' It took a few days to pack their equipment and then his outfit headed to Cologne, Germany. In Cologne, David was given a carbine rifle to take the place of his M-1 rifle. He was then sent to Straubing Germany. While there, he received a letter from his brother, Harvey Roger Weatherford, who was in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia in the 8th Armored Division. Harvey was able to spend 3 days with him in Straubing. They were both excused from all duties for those 3 days by their commanding officers. They both slept in David's pup tent and ate with David's outfit because they weren't allowed to eat in German restaurants. They bathed and washed their clothes in the Blue Danube River. Next, David was sent to Regensburg and there got orders to prepare to go to Japan. Two days later, those orders were put on hold because an atomic bomb was dropped on Japan by the U.S. and soon all of WWII was over. His outfit became an occupational outfit and was moved to Frankfurt, Germany. David was lucky enough to get to work out of the Frankfurt motor pool. The captain was Captain Harrington. David took orders from Colonel Ramsey and 14 other officers under Colonel Ramsey. One of his duties was to go to Paris with thirteen other volunteers to pick up 14 additional cars to bring back to Frankfurt. David was then assigned to Colonel Withers at T.S.F.E.T., the second highest headquarters in Europe. Because he was not officially assigned to the motor pool, his outfit in Wiesbaden thought he had been AWOL for 3 months. David drove Colonel Withers to General Eisenhower's headquarters. There, Eisenhower wrote a note for David to give to the officer in Wiesbaden. It said, 'Give Sergeant Weatherford his records and all his papers at once. He has not been AWOL. He has been driving for the motor pool and our office personnel for the past three months.' Signed Dwight D. Eisenhower. In the middle of March 1946, David found out he had enough points and years of service to be discharged. He rode on a cattle truck to Le Havre, France from Slinging, Germany. He landed by boat at Camp Kilmer, NJ, where he had started his overseas experience in 1945. David was honorably discharged on Easter morning, 1946 at Camp Atterbury, IN.

Dearest Mom and Pap: well I may call this my last letter from over in this part of the world but I don't know for how long I'll have to wait for my trip home but I'm almost on my way. So you really don't have to answer this letter for once�not that you would anyway�but I'm thinking your letter would miss me and may have to follow me around. Anyway, I hope to see you at least within the next few weeks but don't look for me 'cause I may be delayed, and you needn't lay off work until you see the whites of my eyes. But it's the last wait that's so hard to take and I'm rarin' to be on my way. Right now I guess Danny is home on furlough but I'm sure to miss him. Did Mackie and Les go back yet?

By the way, you can have my clothes all ready for me 'cause I think they'll still fit me. They were new when I left but they may be full of moth holes by now. Anyway, if they're alright you might at least get them aired out good because I want to crawl out of my hour in the bath tub to put them on�then watch my smoke. Oh my. For 40 months I have suffered and now for just a night of the wolf�you can warn all the beautiful young gals I'm like a young bull in early spring and I'm on the loose. Well anyway, I hope to be talking to you rather than writing in a very short time so I'll close by saying I hope this is my last letter. Loads of love, Paul. ","","Niece, Becky Snyder Davis",""

Was employed in construction at Fort Riley. Got laid off; not much work in this area. So left for California in December of 1940. After a dish washing job in Los Angeles, I found a job working in a machine shop and manufacture of hydraulic controls in Burbank. I was drafted in December of 1942. Took a few written tests after arriving at Fort Leavenworth. They asked if I would object to going into the Air Corps branch. Went to Basic Training in Miami Beach. Shortly there after, I was transferred to Lowry Field, Colorado; took a training course in bomb sight - automatic pilot and armament, turrets and miscellaneous equipment. I was then interviewed by 5 commissioned officers and sent to Boca Raton, Florida for basic cadets; from there I went to New Haven, Conn. For ground corps officers training. Graduated from there about one year after I was drafted. I was shipped overseas aboard the British ship the 'Duchess of Bedford'. Landing in Scotland. We went by train south into England. Ending our journey at a town by the name of Laveeham. Shortly thereafter the bombers started arriving. The first 46 missions were in B-24s. We then converted to B-17, the re-training for both the air crews and ground personnel took a bit of effort, but was done without too many problems. The maintenance crews, parts supplies and air crews did an outstanding job during this transition. The Group flew their last mission on April 21, 1945; the 185th over Europe. The Group was operational a little less than one year and flew 185 missions. The Group led the Air Force on the largest mission that was flown; they lost (in combat) 232 members. We were to re-deploy throughout the United States; retraining in B-29s. I was to return to the United States on one of the aircraft, but I had the bad luck of coming down with pneumonia; landing in the hospital long enough to miss all flights back. I was taken to South Hampton to return to the United States; returning on the Queen Elizabeth liner. I had 30 days leave to return home and then went to Tampa, Florida to turn in the property book. I decided to end my service time. Then I didn't like how everything had shaped up in Germany and the Eastern Front, so decided to stay in the Reserves. I remained in the Reserves until December of 1965. I retired at the rank of Lt. Colonel. ","","Ralph Snyder",""

I had two older brothers in the service; John was in the Navy submarine service and Eugene was in the Air Corp. My father was the Commander of the Civil Air Patrol during W.W. II in Clay Center, Kansas, and my mother was also a member of the C.A.P. After my boot camp training at the Great Lakes Training Center, I shipped out on the U.S.S. Antares for Pearl Harbor to catch the ship that I would call home for the next 4 � year, the U.S. S. Wright, a seaplane tender. I was assigned the 2nd division aboard the ship, which was a deck division. My General Quarters station was powder man on the five-inch, 51-foot gun. The main responsibility of our ship was to anchor at one of the islands: Johnson, Wake, Midway, Palmspree and Christmas as well as others. Seaplanes would fly in and anchor by our ship and fly out again in the morning a search planes. After their missions were completed, they would fly back to Pearl Harbor and our ship would follow. Our last trip to Wake Island, we transported several Marines; all were either killed in action or captured and spent the rest of the war as P.O.W.'s in Japan doing forced labor. We left Wake Island November 30, 1941 for our return trip to Pearl Harbor. Arriving in Pearl Harbor on December 6, 1942, we found the submarine nets were already in place at the Harbor entrance, so no ships were allowed to enter or exit. That night, we ended up having to anchor outside the Harbor. The next day, December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked and since our ship was not in the Harbor area, we were not hit. It was a very sad sight to see the devastation and destruction of the great and beautiful ships being damaged and sunk. It was horrible, what was happening to those men and women and a horrific and sickening feeling that I'll never forget. One of the Marines that we had just taken over to Pearl on our last trip was a boy from my home town. We had several good visits aboard the U.S. S. Wright and in Honolulu before I left the island. He ended up being wounded and captured after a 16-day defense of the island. After the war, this young man came home and ended up marrying one of my sisters (who had lost her first husband, an air force pilot earlier in the war.) Eventually, an order came through that stated anyone with 30 months overseas was due to return to the United States. It actually took me two weeks to get to Marc Island, California, as we had to find our own way back home. After my discharge, I came home to Clay Center, Kansas and married Vera LaRue Gibbs in 1949. We had five children and have been blessed with several grand and great grandchildren. ","","Wife, Vera; Children, Mike, Monica, Jon and Jean Wernette",""

So in late March 1944, I went to Kansas City, MO, to join on a delayed program which allowed me to finish high school. Five days after graduation I was called to active duty. On 5 Oct 1944, I reported aboard the USS Landing Craft Infantry 998, in San Diego harbor. Right after going aboard, the ship's captain told me to get more clothes. As I was flat broke, I had to wire home for money to get enough clothes to go to sea. The ship went to sea on 10 Oct taking 10 days to get to Pearl Harbor. That was my first experience on BIG water. On 1 Jan 1945 I was sent ashore to a radar school while radar equipment was being installed on my ship. Three days after returning to my ship, it left for the Marshall Islands. Our ship, now a staff ship for the Coast Guard Commander, was his command post and we were outfitted with the latest radio equipment for his convenience. As the ship left Pearl Harbor, carrying the 3rd Marine Division, the sea was rough and did I ever get sea sick. I had never been that sick before and it lasted about 24 hours. The invasion of Iwo Jima Island started on 19 Feb 1945. About 6 hours out, we could see the flashes from the big guns on the battle ships and heavy cruisers pounding the beaches of the island. About 2 hours out we could feel the concussion from the big guns. The 4th day, the Marines left our ship in the 3rd wave. Our commander wasn't very good about staying on station as he wanted to see and be seen. As a result, when the 1st US flag was raised on Mount Suribachi, our ship was just below the mount (about 200 yards away) and we could see the whole action very plainly. The surface of the harbor was covered with debris and litter of one sort or another. The first night our ship stayed in the invasion area all night, Japanese swimmers were reported in the water. Trying to blow up the ships with explosives attached to the hulls, they would get under some debris to stay out of sight while swimming. I was put on watch that night with a submachine gun on the bow and it was pretty frightening. I shot at everything I saw. The ship was at Iwo Jima 7 days and then left for Saipan and Leyte Harbor, Philippine Islands. We took on supplies and equipment and the 2nd wave troops for the new invasion. We left Leyte Harbor on 25 Mar 1945 and 6 days later we were participating in the invasion of Okinawa on 1 Apr 1945 (my 19th birthday). The Japanese 'Kamikaze' planes were very active here; one hit the ship next to us and some of our people were hit by shrapnel. We landed our troops and equipment on the second day. After the 8th day, we took our flotilla and left for the Caroline Islands, arriving on 17 Apr. On 1 May 1945 my rating for 3rd Class Radarman came through (it made little difference except for a little more pay). We left the islands on 7 Jun for Saipan again, arriving on 10 Jun 1945. I was allowed to go ashore and stay overnight with Don Billips, a close school buddy. I really enjoyed seeing someone from home. I got to see him twice more before we left for Leyte Harbor. There, we went on invasion maneuvers again, this time carrying the initial troops for the invasion of Japan proper. As the initial staging area, the harbor was completely full of ships and troops preparing for the invasion (over 2000 ships were at Leyte alone). On 10 Aug 1945 Japan announced their surrender. When the announcement was made that evening, the whole harbor went wild and the ships began shooting off their flares and pyrotechnics and spraying water from fire hoses into the air all night. When dawn came not one ship in the harbor had any flares or pyrotechnics left aboard. Japan signed the official surrender papers on 2 Sep 1945 aboard the Battle Ship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Our ship, with our flotilla, left Leyte Harbor for Sasebo Harbor, Japan (a large Japanese Navy Base heavily damaged ","","Wife, Jean M. White",""

Orders were issued for me, another LT and fourteen EMs to pick up 128 German prisoners from Camp Heilbronn, travel to an area in Northern Italy, secure 128 American vehicles (salvaged from war in Italy) and drive them (or tow them) back to Manheim. Needless to say it turned into a long nightmare. The 'Volunteer' German prisoners could not drive American trucks and could not speak much English (didn't want to learn). The weather was cold and snowy. Since I was a twenty year old officer - 'in charge', the prisoners weren't anxious to take orders from me. After several days on the site, we finally formed the Convoy and headed back to the American Occupation Zone. Our problems with dead batteries, no Prestone, bad tires, short of gasoline, frozen radiators, etc, were overcome by miracles (another story). The Convoy departed the parking lot on a beautiful sunny morning, at daybreak. Morale was high, even among the German prisoners. (Maybe they knew something that we Americans didn't) As the Convoy moved through the beautiful Italian countryside, into Germany up to the outskirts of Munich, I was enjoying the scenery and looking forward to rendezvousing at the Red Cross Donut Center on the outskirts of Munich. Munich is a large city with lots of streets and alleys. When the lead vehicles reached the designated check-point things looked good. Suddenly, it hit me - no other vehicles were arriving. Finally the other LT and the vehicles with American soldiers arrived - few other vehicles showed. A total of twenty-six formed the remaining Convoy. We had lot 102 trucks and about 100 German prisoners had ESCAPED. They knew the Munich territory and had driven their trucks down alleys, streets, behind big buildings, etc. I reported directly to General Keyes, 7th Army Commander, the following morning, thinking my Army career was over and I would be going back to America. Following a discussion with the General and his staff, it was concluded that there was poor planning on their part. I had not received sufficient guards, proper briefings or German prisoners who were qualified to drive American trucks. The American MPs recovered most of the vehicles but few prisoners - (All German prisoners except SS troops were released six months later). The Lord was watching over my time in Germany. Following the great Convoy screw-up, I was assigned to attend the University of Heidelberg, followed by a choice assignment up in the British Zone of Occupation. I commanded a transient mess halfway between Kassel and Bremerhaven, staffed by fifty German, civilian cooks, ten American staff officers and a unit of forty Polish guards.

Benning, GA. There he entered infantry basic training. After a short time in infantry training, he and several others in his unit were pulled out and sent to Fort Riley, KS. To their surprise, they were told that they would be trained as artillery men on the 105mm howitzers. It was later explained that it was important for personnel shooting the big guns in support of the infantry to be trained in the infantry so they could recognize who it felt to have the shells passing overhead. It also emphasized the importance of care and accuracy for the people who shot the cannons. His particular unit was sent to Camp Hood, Texas. There, they were especially designated to train infantry men to advance under friendly artillery fire. A rolling barrage in advance of a forward infantry movement required absolute accurate fire from the artillery. The trainees would be exposed to live fire, the sound, the impact, the danger and the necessity of following orders to avoid being hit by one of the rounds. They did this training at Camp Shelby, MI, where they coordinated with air support for advancing troops. After the war was over in Europe, they were moved to Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri, to join up with the 8th Division and move to the Pacific. The move to the Pacific was cancelled after the dropping of the Nuclear Weapons. Bob was then sent to North Dakota as an Army Recruiter until he was discharged in 1946. After military service, Bob entered Kansas State University. He graduated with a Business Administration Degree in 1949. He took a position in Danville, IN at Kresge Company (now K-Mart). From there, he took a position at Duckwall Stores in 1950 in Salina, KS.

He was sent there to receive troops and work with the Australian government. He was there approximately 1 and 1/2 years and then was sent to Ora Bay in New Guinea where he was Chief Clerk of the Intelligence Department. Serving in New Guinea for about 6 months, he then was suppose to be sent to Manila in the Philippines. At this point, the Colonel of the base asked Clyde to stay in New Guinea and be his Chief Clerk for the island. The Colonel told Clyde if he would stay he would make him a Master Sergeant - which he did. He was there for another year. For those of us not familiar with this part of the world, Clyde said that it is 'down under' the equator, and is hot day and night. Miserably hot - no place for humans to live. He said a lot of our boys got 'jungle rot' and had to be sent back to the States. He remembered eating mostly 'C' or 'E' rations, and having fresh meat or vegetables about once a month when a ship would come to supply them. Having no refrigeration on the island, they had to eat what fresh food they had immediately as it would not 'keep'. The only way to cool off was swimming in the ocean. From New Guinea he was sent to Cebu in the Philippines. It is a small island 10 miles wide and 30 miles long. Cebu was a town on the island with a population of 50,000 people. All of the buildings in the town had been destroyed by U.S. airplanes except for three. The U.S. took the island back from the Japanese. Clyde said, 'I found out the American Division was on the island an Curtis Armour, a cousin, was with this outfit and I got to visit with him.' He left Cebu and was sent to the island of Leyete, also in the Philippines. He served our country in Intelligence for the rest of the war.

Processing was completed at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, and he was assigned to Battery 'B' 17th Field Artillery Regiment transportation section at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The 17th trained at Fort Bragg, Camp Blanding, FL., and while participating in the Carolina maneuvers were ordered back to Fort Bragg on the 23rd of July to move overseas. The unit moved to Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, for equipment and staging and sailed from New York Harbor on Aug. 5, 1942, landing in Liverpool, England on Aug. 17, 1942.

After months of training in England the 17th Field Artillery Regiment shipped out of Liverpool on November 22, 1942 and landed at Oran, Algeria North Africa on December 6, 1942. With more training in the Oran area the first unit of the 17th moved on to the Tunisian Campaign and fired their first rounds at Kasserine Pass on February 3, 1943. Charles and brother Sheldon met during the Battle of El Guettar, March 28, 1943. Sheldon was a First Sergeant with the 34th Field Artillery Battery 'B', 9th Infantry Division. With the end of the Tunisian Campaign the Regiment was moved to the rest area for training and recreation. Their next move was to a staging area at the Port of Tunis for the assault on Sicily. The regiment boarded Landing Ship Tank (LST) and Landing Craft Infantry (LCI) for the assault landing at Gila, Sicily on July 14, 1943. The unit moved north across Sicily and took up position on the northern coast. Charles met brother Elmer near Palermo, Sicily in Aug. 1943. Elmer was at a rest area with 68th AAA Gun Battalion preparing to depart for Italy.

The First Battalion of the 17th Field Artillery Regiment sailed from Termini Immerse, Sicily and landed in Italy on Sept. 23, 1943. At this point in Charles's service record there are some dates that are not too clear. Charles was relieved of duty while he was in the hospital for two months. When he returned to duty in March 1944 the 17th Field Artillery Regiment had been reorganized and he was transferred to a replacement center.

It is believed that sometime in April 1944, Charles was assigned to the 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division who were at this date engaged in the battle at Anzio. The Regiment was in the forefront for the breakout at Anzio for the attack on Rome. After the fall of Rome the unit moved south to Naples, Italy for rest and training in preparation for the invasion of Southern France. On August 15, 1944 the Regiment made an assault landing at St. Maxine, France. After the landing the 157th spearheaded a drive for the Belfort Gap and crossed the Mortagne River on October 23, 1944. While at a rest area on November 8, 1944 Charles was granted a day furlough to the States. He departed Europe on November 17, 1944 and returned to duty on March 1, 1945. When Charles returned to duty the unit was at rest and training for an attack on the Siegfried Line.

A short time after Charles returned to duty from the furlough to the States he was promoted from Staff Sergeant in the transportation section in the 157th Infantry Regiment to First Sergeant and was reassigned to the 158th Field Artillery Battalion, Battery 'A'.

The Siegfried Line was crossed on March 17, and the city of Nuremberg was taken on April 20, 1945. The 3rd Battalion of the 157th Infantry Regiment liberated the Dachau concentration camp on April 29, 1945 and at days end was on the outskirts of Munich. The end of combat for the 45th Infantry Division came on April 30, 1945 with the surrender of Munich. The 45th Infantry Division occupied the city of Munich and setup a collection point and camp for surrendering troops of the German Army. In June 1945 the 45th Infantry Division returned to the States and was deactivated on Dec. 7, 1945 at Camp Bowie, Texas.

We enlisted in the 77th Company of the Massachusetts State Guard at Cohasset, Massachusetts in the summer of 1942. We reported once a week for training at the Ripley Road School auditorium. We received basic military training such as close order marching and manual arms using wooden rifles and shot guns. This basic training became very helpful to me once I enlisted in the Army Air Corps. On September 28th 1942 I received my discharge from the Massachusetts State Guard.
In August 1942 I decided to leave High School and join my three brothers in the Armed Forces. On September 30, 1942 I enlisted in the Army Air Corps at Boston, Massachusetts and was processed at Fort Devens, Massachusetts. After being processed I was transferred to Army Air Corps Classification and Training Center at Atlantic City, New Jersey. This Center was composed of many hotels along the Atlantic City boardwalk. I was assigned to room number 108 in the world famous Traymore Hotel. At this Center the Army Air Corps recruits received basic military training, medical exams, and a battery of technical skills tests. I was qualified to receive technical training as an aircraft and engine technician. My military training at this center was very limited because of my previous training with the Massachusetts State Guard.

In November 1942 I was selected to attend the Army Air Corps Technical School at Lincoln, Nebraska. This was a comprehensive sixteen week course on the inspection, repair and maintenance of all aircraft systems and engines. After completion of this school I requested special training on pursuit aircraft. In March 1943 I received orders to attend the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Factory School in Buffalo, New York. This school was an accelerated four week course on the inspection, repair and maintenance of the P-40 aircraft. With the completion of this course I requested transfer to a P-40 unit in the combat theater.
At the end of April 1943 I received my first permanent base assignment to the 63rd Ferrying Squadron, 552nd Army Air Force Base Unit [2nd Ferrying Group] Ferrying Division, Air Transport Command, New Castle Army Air Base in Wilmington, Delaware. The Second Ferrying Group was one of seven groups in the Ferrying Division during World War Two. They delivered all types of aircraft throughout the world to support combat units. The Second Ferry Group was also the home of the first Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron [WAFS], under the command of Lt. Col. Nancy Love.

It was at New Castle Army Air Base where I was issued my first tool box and was told to report to the Line Chief on the Pursuit aircraft flight line. The aircraft included two P-38s, a P-39, an old beat up P-40, and two P-47s. I was asked to crew the P-40 as I had just attended a course on this aircraft. Crew members were required to cross train on all aircraft on the flight line. These aircraft were used for pilot first flight check out and for proficiency flying.

In November 1943 I attended the Northrop Aircraft Factory Training School in Hawthorne, California. This was a one month advanced mechanics training course on the new P-61 aircraft. After completion of this school I requested a transfer to a P-61 squadron but I ended up back at New Castle Air Base Wilmington, Delaware. I was reassigned to the Medium Bomber Flight line crew which included B-26 and A-30 aircraft. These aircraft came directly from the factory. Ferry crews used these aircraft for training flights before delivering them to combat units around the world. My first aircraft flight was in a B-26 [ Better known as a Flying Coffin] while working on this flight line. The flight was to Fort Dix, New Jersey to check out a B-26 that had made an emergency landing because of an oil leak.

Paul wrote lots of letters home. The following is the last letter he wrote from Zamboangoa on Mindanao before being discharged:
Aug. 6, 1945
Dearest Mom and Pap: well I may call this my last letter from over in this part of the world but I don't know for how long I'll have to wait for my trip home but I'm almost on my way. So you really don't have to answer this letter for once�not that you would anyway�but I'm thinking your letter would miss me and may have to follow me around. Anyway, I hope to see you at least within the next few weeks but don't look for me 'cause I may be delayed, and you needn't lay off work until you see the whites of my eyes. But it's the last wait that's so hard to take and I'm rarin' to be on my way. Right now I guess Danny is home on furlough but I'm sure to miss him. Did Mackie and Les go back yet? I hope not as I'm surely looking forward to seeing them. It's surely too bad about Blanche and Deemer wrecking their car�besides getting all banged up themselves. Hope they're feeling alright again. By the way, you can have my clothes all ready for me 'cause I think they'll still fit me. They were new when I left but they may be full of moth holes by now. Anyway, if they're alright you might at least get them aired out good because I want to crawl out of my hour in the bath tub to put them on�then watch my smoke. Oh my. For 40 months I have suffered and now for just a night of the wolf�you can warn all the beautiful young gals I'm like a young bull in early spring and I'm on the loose. Well anyway, I hope to be talking to you rather than writing in a very short time so I'll close by saying I hope this is my last letter. Loads of love, Paul.","","Niece, Becky Snyder Davis",""

Following basic training in Fresno, California, he was trained as a gunner ' armorer in Kingman, Arizona, Denver, Colorado, and Harvard, Nebraska.  He and his crew flew their own plane to England in December 1943 where they were deployed.

He was a waist gunner on a B17.  Their first mission was a rough one as they encountered lots of enemy fire from the ground and the air, ending up with quite a bit of damage to the plane, but had a successful bomb run.  On the second mission he and the other waist gunner were frostbitten on their faces as the B17 at that time had no protection from the open windows.

The fifth bombing mission started out well but before reaching their target the plane had one engine fail, then two, and then three.  They turned back to base with fighter protection but kept losing altitude.  Enemy aircraft spotted them and it ended with their plane on fire and going down.  Two crew members were killed before being able to parachute to safety and others were injured.  Frank came down without a scratch.

He was taken to an interrogation room, was threatened and was scared and lonely.  He never saw any of his crew again.  After several days of interrogation he was  sent to prison camp Stalag Luft III.  He volunteered along with eleven others to accept Red Cross parcels of food and to distribute them along with any other food the Germans provided.

The Germans had them puncture any canned food before issuing it, so it couldn’t be kept and stored for escape purposes.  Prisoners learned to seal the cans with margarine so after discovering their secret, the guards then made the crew remove all tops to the cans, with a hand can opener before they were issued.

As time went on the fighting got so close that an evacuation was ordered.  They left in the middle of the night with lots of snow on the ground and traveled in below zero weather for 6 days, 62 miles to Stalag X111, on the outskirts of Nuernberg . This long journey caused many cases of frostbite  to the prisoners hands and feet, including Franks.  Two months later in April 1945 they evacuated that camp as fighting came closer again, and again 10,000 prisoners marched  to Moosberg, 30 miles from Munich to  Stalag. V11A.  They were there until shortly before the war ended when Patton’s army liberated them.  Staff Sargent Fordyce served with honor and courage, and was given the Purple Heart and other medals that reflected his uncompromising service.  Staff Sargent Fordyce and many other prisoners were put on Liberty ships in France and made their way back to the USA.  Three weeks after arriving home on furlough he married his high school sweetheart Virginia Madge Ramsey on July 8, 1945.

Frank received his discharge on November 5, 1945.  A new career was started as he was employed at a Rare Plant Garden in Pasadena, California, and he went  from there to other orchid nurseries where he worked for 27  years before founding a successful orchid nursery in Livermore, California.  Frank owned and managed that nursery for the rest of his life along with his wife, Madge, daughter, Sue, and son, Steve.

He ended his career at the age of  82 as  being one of the most successful hybridizers of Cattleya Orchids of his time. Frank passed on at age 87 leaving a legacy that began as a young 19 year old POW who honored his country, and he wept each time an American flag was raised and the solemn notes of Taps floated into the air.","emiller@eisenhowerfoundation.net","Virginia Madge Fordyce, (Wife of 66 years)",""

Denius landed on Omaha Beach on June 7 (D-Day+1) and was engaged in all five major battles of the European Theater, including 'Operation Cobra' at St. Lo, the breakthrough battle into France. 
During the famous stand at Mortain, Denius was one of just 700 Allied soldiers on Hill 314 who were cut off for six days as they were surrounded by 70,000 German troops and 6 armored divisions. During this intense battle, the nearby 230th Artillery emptied some of their non-artillery shells and filled them with medical supplies. Frank Denius directed the shelling of his own position and at least some of the critically needed supplies landed intact to treat the wounded. Ordered to hold the hill at all costs, Denius directed artillery fire that decimated the massive German counteroffensive. Hill 314 was successfully defended, stopping the Germans’ march to the sea, which would have divided the Allied Army as they began their critical advance into France. His unit later broke through the Siegfried line, then fought in the Battle of the Bulge.
Staff Sgt. Denius was awarded two Purple Hearts, four Silver Stars and the Presidential Citation, making him one of the 10 most decorated soldiers of the European Front in World War II. Denius returned home in 1945 and enrolled in the University of Texas. He was blessed with 64 years of marriage to his beloved wife, Charmaine, and they have two children. Denius is a devoted fan and supporter of the University of Texas.  He continues to practice law in Austin and gives generously of his time and talents. 
At wars end, General Eisenhower ordered Col. S.L.A. Marshall, chief historian for the Army, to evaluate all units that fought in the European Theater. Marshall determined that the 30th Infantry Division was the “top rated” division and recommended that it be awarded the Presidential Unit Citation — an honor “Old Hickory” has yet to receive. Recently, efforts have been renewed to recognize the Division’s heroic service, a story detailed in the documentary, 'Heroes of Old Hickory.'","","Eisenhower Foundation",""

Carlo.jpg","Image","Army","Alsos Mission","European","Captain","01/20/1941","","","As a medical doctor specializing in pharmacology and a native German speaker, Carlo Henze served as a Captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps. He was assigned as a medical intelligence officer to the top-secret Alsos Mission in Europe, whose goal was to determine German progress in developing an atomic bomb and biological and chemical weapons. At times Alsos team members operated behind enemy lines. Carlo's citation for the Legion of Merit mentions his imagination, skill and ingenuity, which made possible the successful completion of an investigation regarding these projects and their possible relationship to comparable Japanese programs. Through his daring and acceptance of risks beyond the call of duty, Captain Henze directed and participated in the location and seizure of secret German records revealing full details of the German research program.

In addition to his official mission in Europe, Carlo had a personal priority - to reunite with his parents in Austria after not seeing them for six years. His father had been a professor of biochemistry at the University of Innsbruck. He lost his job and his pension because he would not allow Nazi uniforms in his classroom. The reunion finally took place two days after VE Day, on May 11, 1945. Carlo's war experience, including the reunion with his parents, was a high point of his life. After the war he resumed work at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, where he became a Vice President and later, President of the Sandoz Foundation. In his retirement home, he always kept his helmet on a chair beside his bed.

Our Drop Zone was 'DZ C'. Our objective was to provide security for Division HQ's (101st Abn Div), and to be held in ready reserve for any situation that might arise. Our flight path was probably parallel in straight line from Le Port to Hiesville, and very likely we were dropped too soon. And far enough south of that line so as to arrive at the south bank of the Douve River and we arrived near daybreak in the area of Le Port, which is located on the Ste. Mere Eglise map.
The Douve appears to be flowing southeast in that area and then veers off to a more southern direction at the bottom of the map. This accounts for the 16th man in our jump-stick ending up on the other side of the river!
The Germans in that area seemed to have been on the alert, because our scout, 'Lavern French', was captured. Then we received machine-gun fire while we were crossing a road upshot of which our squad was divided.
As the sun was just beginning to bring light that morning we saw a German patrol walking beyond a short hedgerow. In retrospect, the patrol was walking along the dike of the river and had a hedgerow running parallel to it. We walked along that hedgerow until we found a gap/break. I, McMullen, and Paraseau had just emerged on the other side when another German patrol came walking along the dike. We froze and hoped we wouldn't be seen in the faint light of dawn, but that wasn't to be! Now we had been instructed to protect ourselves, but you must remember, we were trained to fight as a unit, so don't start any 'little wars', get to your assembly area at all costs!
Well, the moment we were spotted, McMullen opened up with his sub-machine gun. I looked up and saw the patrol hitting the ground and threw a grenade. I guess Mac felt we had them neutralized, because he said, 'lets get out of here'. Since Mac and Paraseau were closest to the gap, we had came thru, I waited a couple seconds and threw another grenade. I waited for it to go off, then I headed for the gap, only to find Mac struggling to get thru the hedge with his sub-machine gun. Well, I gave him one mighty shove and that's when everything happened, all at once. Mac fell forward and his feet were above my face and the German behind us on the dike opened up with his burp gun. I felt my carbine being wrenched from my hands, and a burning, stinging on the right-side of my face (cheek). At that point, I fell all over Mac and panicked! I got up on the run, feeling my bloodied cheek with my right hand. I ran faster then my feet, stumbling all over myself. I knew I must have a hole in my head, so I tore off my helmet and kept feeling for the hole I just knew must be in my head.
A couple hundred yards down that same hedgerow, I slowed down enough for Paraseau to catch up with me. He said, 'you'd better bandage that wound'. And I could see him looking at my right hand in the dim morning light. It was at this time I saw a gash running along the inside of my right wrist, with blood still spurting out. I then realized the bullet that stung me in the right cheek must have also gashed the blood vessel in my right wrist.
Relieved that it wasn't my head, but just my right wrist that was damaged, I said, 'yes, I guess your right'. So I reached around with my left hand to retrieve my First Aid Kit off my Cartridge Belt. But I knew something was wrong? I was not having any luck getting hold of it? So I brought my left hand around to look at it and was startled to staring at the rounded bone of the first joint of my thumb! The fore-finger was dangling down on one side of my hand and the middle finger down the other side! I guess it was dumb of me, but I remember trying to put them back to where they belonged, only to find the bones in my hand that they had been connected to had partially been blown away!
Well, I took my shot of morphine out of my First Aid Kit and we went to work bandaging my hands, only to be interrupted by 12 or so Germans. They stripped us of everything we had except for our dog tags and uniforms. They made us put our hands on our heads and marched us off to a CP, or Medical Station a mile or so away. They had a couple of their own guys there with shrapnel wounds so we had quite a party wrapping wounds. I must have passed out on them, and when I came to, they had one of our medics try giving me blood plasma, but they couldn't get it in my veins, and they finally gave up on me.
Later, they brought in Mike Kinzer, who had been separated from our group when they had fired on us crossing the road earlier in the morning. That afternoon they loaded Kinzer, Paraseau and the medic and me on an open truck and took us back to the rear, (or at least I thought it was the rear)? They dropped the medic and me off at a Field Hospital and took Kinzer and Paraseau on to Germany as POW's where they spent the rest of the war. Although I was pretty well out of it, I got the impression the field hospital had been established in a school house or seminary. (If I remember right, it was at least two stories high and was adjacent to a church). They took the medic and me to a room on the second floor which had a wounded British Soldier in it (RAF if I recall). The next morning (7 June) they sent the medic on to the rear.
The next day, Thursday, the 8th, with an additional 2 or 3 POW's in the room, an artillery shell exploded just outside our room. It blew a hole in the wall and sent a piece of shrapnel into the room. Later that day they tried to take me down-stairs to examine my wounds. But I passed out on them. As I remember, from the wound's I received on D-Day. I kept drifting in and out of consciousness.
On Friday, 9 June, they took me down-stairs. My hand was swollen about the size of my head and the bandages that had been on since D-Day were all crusted to where they had to use scissors to cut them off. They pointed to the streaks running up my arm and suggested the hand be amputated. I vigorously shook my head 'no'. So they shrugged their shoulders and wrapped my hand back up.
Saturday the 10th they brought us all down-stairs to a courtyard where we now totaled 21 POW's all-together. The Germans were evacuating the facility, loading their own wounded on trucks.
Of our 21 wounded POW's, a few were 101st and 82nd troopers, but most were off Omaha Beach and some Brits or maybe Canadians off their beaches? They provided us with a horse drawn carriage or wagon with straw mattresses on it. But no horse, so some of us were pushing and pulling it with those who couldn't walk were riding. They also provided us with 6 guards. Three were teenagers and three were older, maybe 40 or 50 years of age. The guards were not Germans. I believe they were eastern Europeans. 5 of them were riding bicycles.
We didn't get started until afternoon. So we didn't get far before we stopped for the night and stayed in a barn for the rest of the night.
On Sunday 11 June, we came to a fork in the road. The guards didn't know which way to go, so 1/2 of them went one way, and the other 1/2 the other way. They abandoned us! Some French people took us to a slate mine, in the neighborhood we spent Sunday night.
The next day, Monday 12 June, elements of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division (The Big Red 1) came into the area and took us back to Omaha Beach where we were loaded on an LST. We landed back in England the morning of 13 June. 
In England they put a cast on my left arm and hand. I never got back to the 101st Airborne area. I ended up in a hospital at an airfield in Scotland where I ran into McMullen on crutches. He had received a wound in his knee from the blast of the burp gun that got me. Remember I saw his feet above my head when I shoved him thru the gap in the hedgerow? He, Houston, and the medic evidently took off in a different direction from Paraseau and me. They hid in a low-lying area until mid morning on D-Day then waded the river where they joined up with Col. Johnson and the others in their D-Day mission, at the bridges on that day. Sgt. Houston suffered a shrapnel wound to his foot before the Normandy campaign was over. But he went on through all the operations the 101st was involved in and as a matter of fact, was awarded a battlefield commission before the end of the war. 
From the Scotland Hospital and Airfield, I was put aboard a C-54 Hospital Ship as an ambulatory patient and landed in New York on July 3, 1944 at about 3 AM in the morning. My D-Day jump was my 13th and final jump. Outside a couple flights, I've hardly been in an airplane since. I married an Army Nurse before being discharged. We have 3 sons, 11 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. I spent 38 years at Beech Aircraft as a Production Planner and retired in 1989.
I'm afraid my time in the service didn't amount to much, but I wouldn't have missed it for anything!
